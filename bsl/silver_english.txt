I saw all eight of them about an hour ago.
Do you want me to tell you what Tom did?
Tom told Mary to keep the door closed.
I'm here to ask for your cooperation.
We're having a party Friday evening.
I was your mother's first boyfriend.
I'm just saying it's a possibility.
Tom is asleep, but Mary is awake.
I'm looking for a friend of mine.

You're a soldier now.
You're a little late.
You're a good kisser.
You have to try, Tom.
You can ride with me.

How far would Tom go?
The lamp needs to be filled with oil.
How far can you go?
Can I ask who?
What did you turn up?
How is this fair?
Shouldn't you wear gloves?
Do you see this?
Do you carry weapons?
Who else do you miss?
How does it help us?
How about I do that?
How did we do that?
How weird is that?
How awesome is that?
How do we know that?
But why is it all so secret?
Did you take it?
How did Tom like it?
How do parents do it?
Do you feel up to it?
How accurate is it?
How special is it?
What have we got?
Can I be honest?
Are you freaking out?
So how mad are you?
How do I thank you?
What do I call you?
What's got into you?
Can I tell Tom why?
Have you considered therapy?
What an awful mess!
OK, I get the idea.
I feel quite bad.
Tom may be injured or dead.
In school, Tom was often bullied.
The kids weren't impressed.
I would've done exactly what you did.
This shouldn't be too hard.
I called the police.
Now is your chance.
I scraped my knee.
I've got to be free.
I gave Tom an apple.
This is an old rule.
Tom was like me.
You don't have to hide anything from me.
I must be going home.
You were asleep by the time I got home.
Give me that cane.
Tom doesn't drink red wine.
Thank you for all you've done.
My keys are gone.
I never gave up hope.
Something isn't right here.
I have friends there.
No one did anything else.
Sometimes you just want to eat chocolate.
I feel like a slave.
I did some checking.
No one was listening.
Have a wonderful evening.
I got married young.
Tom was the only one who didn't know how to speak French.
I'll do as you wish.
They didn't speak.
I have you to thank.
Tom thought you were drunk.
I went back to work.
There's absolutely no risk.
I want to travel.
You can rely on Tom.
I'll be good to Tom.
We had to help Tom.
I'm glad we saw Tom.
Come back as soon as you can.
I have another plan.
Men aren't so different from women.
Tom and Mary didn't wait for John.
Do it once again.
I could do it again.
Get a move on.
I still need to ask Tom for permission.
Come and see me soon.
Tom doesn't like Boston.
That would've been fun.
There's so much left to do.
I like dogs, too.
We'll be needing your help.
I should've studied harder.
Tom's grandfather knew my grandfather.
I know your brother.
You should've quit earlier.
It's getting better.
I like you better.
I wrote that letter.
I want to be a taxi driver.
Tom often sings when he's in the shower.
I'm your new lawyer.
We're already good friends.
I've made so many mistakes.
Tom is too stupid to understand your jokes.
Look at the sharks.
Tom handed me the binoculars.
You can't go with us.
Tom used to drive a bus.
I'm glad we met.
Tom will tell you when he feels like it.
I thought about it.
I do worry about it.
Tom stared at the document.
I was too fast.
Tom has done his best.
This door has been welded shut.
The police are here to talk to you.
Tom took the pillowcase off the pillow.
I'm a man now.
I ought to go now.
I'm your boss now.
I thought you'd be ready by now.
Bring your tool box.
I got up early today.
I thought you'd be angry.
I know you've been busy.
Tom told me he was busy.
I think the box is empty.
I attended the party.
Why is Tom tired?
Are you two related?
What is it you think I did?
What did Tom think you did?
Can I get a refund?
Can we be overheard?
What can it be?
Is Tom still single?
What did Tom call me?
Have you forgiven me?
Do you follow me?
Do you sell wine?
Why am I still here?
Are you really sure?
Has Tom told you everything?
What else needs fixing?
Haven't I suffered enough?
Shouldn't you take a break?
What did Tom think?
Does this still work?
How can I stop Tom?
Did you shoot Tom?
What did it all mean?
Who would you vote for?
What was I looking for?
Who are we working for?
Do you think they might be dangerous?
Is it as bad as that?
Why haven't you talked to Tom about this yet?
How late is it?
How did you make out?
Don't expect everyone to like you.
Why bring it up now?
Why did you go away?
Who else was at Tom's party?
I dance truly bad.
It was a full moon yesterday.
Yesterday afternoon I wrote a letter.
My dad took us to the zoo yesterday.
I assumed that it was free.
This costs nothing.
When I grow up, I'm going to get married to Tom.
I'll get it back.
You have to see it.
Happy Walpurgis Night!
You got cheated.
When do you use it?
Enter your username, followed by your password.
Drink your medicine.
She ate an apple.
He ate an apple.
You may follow along.
Happy name day.
The keyboard is backlit.
The dog followed along with me.
The man died waiting for an ambulance.
I like climbing.
When I came home, my father had already been there.
The apples are big.
The risk is small.
No one will find out.
Looks like today will be a long day.
When I don't have my cell phone, I feel lonely.
Even my mom knows it.
I am a widow.
The winter grew colder and colder; he was obliged to swim about on the water to keep it from freezing, but every night the space on which he swam became smaller and smaller.
At length it froze so hard that the ice in the water crackled as he moved, and the duckling had to paddle with his legs as well as he could, to keep the space from closing up.
He became exhausted at last, and lay still and helpless, frozen fast in the ice.
Tom's sandcastle was destroyed by the storm.
I hate to iron.
We'll talk about that soon.
Here I am again.
I've only done this once before.
How did you know that I was going to ask you that question?
Would you like a cappuccino?
Tom didn't like his sandwich.
Tom has an older sister, Mary, and two younger sisters, but I don't remember their names.
I don't know.
I can't remember.
I still think about her.
I still think about him.
I'm not being cruel.
There's something wrong with him.
There's something wrong with her.
There's something wrong with you.
I saw a very interesting documentary yesterday.
I'm sure it would be a mistake to tell Tom.
Thanks for your comments.
I don't want another drink.
You have no idea, do you?
I want to become a doctor.
I want to eat some Korean food that isn't spicy.
I want to eat Chinese noodles.
I want to eat pizza.
I want to eat something that isn't sweet.
I want to eat something that I can only eat here.
It's cold, so I want to eat something hot.
It's hot, so I want to eat something cold.
I want to play tennis with you someday.
I want to go to another country.
I really want to know what's going on here.
I'd like to sing a song.
I'd like a glass of wine.
I want to go there again.
I want to go there once again.
Can I have my keys?
The gardener was a murderer.
My mother's father is my maternal grandfather.
You have to follow the rules.
You don't have to say anything you don't want to say.
He bought the pre-cut pork loin.
She doesn't seem very modest.
She has many good qualities.
Could you keep an eye on this bag for me for a little while?
We all knew about it.
I have a strong will.
The abbess asked Mary if she was completely sure that the monastic life fit her.
If you don't want to say anything, you don't have to.
If you don't want to sing, you don't have to.
If you don't want to give a speech, you don't have to.
You don't have to say anything if you don't feel like it.
The two of us are finally alone.
Be honest with me.
Tom sang for Mary.
He barely speaks to me anymore.
She barely speaks to me anymore.
Tom just sent me an email.
How many games do you have in your collection?
We have to report to the immigration office.
The only language Tom can speak is French.
He walks on crutches.
We will have to postpone the meeting.
Tom had lost his French textbook.
The bird was sitting in the tree wagging its tail.
Do you have WhatsApp?
What's the matter, darling?
2015 has been declared the International Year of Light by the United Nations.
Women change the world.
Tom lay awake for a long time thinking about what he should do.
If the weather's good tomorrow, let's go to the river to swim.
Judith's German accent is beautiful.
The French word "soleil" means "sun".
Ah, snow!
Would you like to be my friend?
I want to write a letter to Santa.
But can Santa read Japanese?
How long have you liked Tom?
Do girls also masturbate?
I think that guys who can play piano are cool.
Is there anyone here who knows someone in Australia?
You're Tom, right? It's been a while.
I love it.
The bird is in the sky.
Why didn't you go first?
I was speaking only German.
How many girls are there in this picture?
Again, many thanks for your support!
Tom didn't use the word "impossible."
"What's that?" "How am I supposed to know?"
Tom Jackson lived to be 93.
Draw a picture of yourself.
Can I borrow yours?
Did I invite you?
No one has voted yet.
I told you yesterday.
Why did you say yes?
I want to workout.
My plan is working.
Do you still think I'm the one you want to spend the rest of your life with?
I brought some wine.
Go easy on the wine.
I washed the windows.
I'm not at all well.
We're not going to make it in time, are we?
This is all I want.
I forgot my wallet.
Can you still walk?
I want to vote.
Do you like venison?
Are you on vacation?
Pray for all of us.

What did you ask Tom?
How old are you, Tom?
How do you feel, Tom?
Are you coming, Tom?
I still remember Tom.
I really love Tom.
I did surprise Tom.
I really loved Tom.
I just fired Tom.
I know that, Tom.
Do you work together?
We make every decision together.
Can you start today?
I have to work today.
I broke a vase today.
Who can I sell it to?
I never got tired.
Now I feel tired.
I have two tickets.
We've sold all the tickets.
How much is a ticket?
Why do you want this?
When did you do this?
Can I use this?
Have you tried this?
I hope I can do this.
I miss all this.
I hope you like this.
I also found this.
I really needed this.
I saw many things.
I have my things.
I hate those things.
How large were they?
How large are they?
Do you like these?
I hope to be there.
I should be there.
How do we stop them?
Did you catch them?
Do you like them?
Do you need them?
I never trusted them.
Why do you want that?
I would enjoy that.
I read about that.
I intend to do that.
I had to do that.
I can still do that.
I already sold that.
I really needed that.
I never noticed that.
Tom's parents are teachers.
I trust the teacher.
I love to teach.
I love that tattoo.
I had my suspicions.
I hope I survive.
I was very surprised.

I always thought so.
I made a snowman.

It'll take a few seconds.
Will you please be seated?
Did you bring rolls?

Now I want to rest.
Now I feel relieved.
I really like red.
I have my reasons.
You have to be ready.

Where can I find it?
I have to try it.
Go on and say it.
I highly doubt it.
I'm not good at it.
We have to do it.
Go ahead and do it.
I never could do it.
I forgot to watch it.
I have to change it.
I already did it.
I initially hated it.
I don't even know who he is.

Can I walk you home?
Tonight, I'll stay at home.
I have it at home.
My mother is at home.
What do we want here?
Why did you come back here?
When can I get out of here?
What exactly happened here?
I knew you'd be happy here.
It almost never snows here.
All my stuff is here.
I hope you like being here.
Tom shouldn't even be here.
We're almost finished here.
Nothing I did helped.
I think I'll shave my head.
Hold onto your hats.
Next time, I'll try harder.
I tried really hard.
We all know what'll happen.
It's time to go to the gym.

Go wash your face.
Come on, close your eyes.
I need to exercise.
Your French is excellent.
They do that to everyone.

We have more than enough.
Do we have anything else?
I may be elected.
I got you something to eat.
I took it easy.
Don't give up so easily.
I left the party too early.
I left too early.
I guess I'm a little drunk.
I need you to drive.
What conclusions can we draw?
What were you really doing?
How did they do?
I washed the dishes.
Tom is discouraged.
With Tom, it would've been different.
Has someone died?
Tom didn't say what he did.
The train has been delayed.
Have you already started to decorate?
I hope we've made the right decision.
It looks like you've finally decided.
How did you spend your day?
I practiced every day.
It'll be a long day.
What a lousy day!
I filled the cup.
I want an ice cream.

Have fun in Boston.
I've got the blues.
I can ride a bike.
I wanted the best.
Do I smell bacon?
I put it back.
Maybe I fell asleep.
Why would I say anything?
Do I have to do anything?
Have I forgotten anything?
I didn't vote for anyone.
You can't do that anymore.
It's really very annoying.
Does Tom know where I am?
They don't know who I am.
Tom is so much older than I am.
I miss it already.
I trust you all.
I wasn't scared at all.
Does that mean you agree?
Oh yeah, I totally agree.
Perhaps we'll meet again.
Now we're together again.

You can't be late this time.
This seems like harassment.
I need you to listen.
Would you like a dash of milk in your tea?
Do you want to give me a heart attack or what?
We'll have to postpone the meeting.
How about ice cream with chocolate sauce for dessert?
Tom hurt himself on a rusty nail.
The Swedish "sj" sound can be pronounced several different ways.
Stop that nonsense.
Stop harassing me!
The school lies in that direction.
The situation was very comical.
Look me in the eyes.
Otherwise, it means nothing.
Look me in the eye, so I know if you are saying the truth.
The sauce got burnt and stuck to the bottom of the pan.

The island is six times the size of Manhattan.
You poor thing.
Why did you do such a stupid thing?
This is the first time I've seen such a big strawberry.
Did you come alone?
Where is your luggage?
The competition is getting tougher and tougher.

It is late.
Eat your soup while it's warm.
I just found them.
She was very afraid of him.
I keep a diary.
I work nights.
How beautifully you write!

What did you say to them?
They're older than him.
Tell him what you heard.
Tell her I said hello.
Somebody has to stop him.
I've seen her.
