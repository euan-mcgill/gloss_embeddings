You have to be ready.
I'm curious.

Tom is one of my friends.
Even Tom thinks so.
That tie goes well with your shirt.
Are those your bags?
All my stuff is here.
Tom didn't want to go there with Mary.
I am a teacher.
Be quick about it.
I sure had my due reward.
I came from China.
Tom is determined.
He said that he was going home the following day.

I believe he is honest.
Do you like venison?
He saw a dog near the door.
He felt very tired.
