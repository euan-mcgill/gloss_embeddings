deaf person be sign over re but ix-2p be also hearing voice dear over here
sound ix-3p-pl-arc voice help ix-2p to make connection to who ix-3p-pl-arc be but now
re be real implication behind value speech culture and what ix-3p:j mean when ix-3p:j kissinger give voice
ix-3p:j drivingmean like <unk> when ix-3p-pl-arc transfer ix-3p-pl-arc voice to <unk>
voice can tell ix-2p if person be intelligent wher or not ix-3p-pl-arc go to college and wher or not ix-3p-pl-arc go to college and wher or not ix-3p-pl-arc go to college and wher or not ix-3p-pl-arc go to college and wher or not ix-3p-pl-arc go to college and wher
so when ix-2p meet deaf person and have experience where ix-2p encounter ix-3p-pl-arc and ix-3p-pl-arc do ltte talk ix-2p try to figure ix-3p-pl-arc out
secondmarco whose voice ix-3p:j be when sound be come from different direction
if ix-2p speak fast ix-3p:j mean that ix-2p come smart <unk> smooth and have sharp mind
and dear over here and ix-3p-pl-arc feel experience unrestricted who be speak
<unk> information from voice that tell ix-3p-pl-arc character ix-3p-pl-arc personality and ix-3p-pl-arc job gender sexual orientation 49 sexual orientation 49 sexual orientation 49 sexual orientation 49 sexual orientation 49 sexual orientation
people who watch silent film usa malaysium hear ix-3p:j but can imagine strong heavy usa malaysium hear ix-3p:j but can imagine strong heavy <unk> voice from that <unk> character from that <unk> character from that <unk> character from that <unk> character from that <unk> character from that <unk> character from that <unk> character from that <unk> character from that <unk> character from that <unk> character from that <unk> character from that <unk> character from that <unk> character from that <unk> character from that <unk> character from that <unk> character from that <unk> character from that <unk> character from that <unk> character from that <unk> character from that <unk> character from that <unk> character from that <unk> character from that <unk> character from that <unk> character from that <unk> character from that <unk> character from that <unk> character from that <unk> character from that <unk> character from that <unk> character from that <unk> character from that <unk> character from that <unk> character from that <unk> character from that <unk> character from that <unk> character from that <unk> character from that <unk> character from that <unk> character from that <unk> character from that <unk> character from that <unk> character from that <unk> character from that <unk> character from that <unk> character from that <unk> character from that <unk> character from that <unk> character from that <unk> character from that <unk> character from that <unk> character from that <unk> character from that <unk> character from that <unk> character from that <unk> character from
ix-1p-pl have ix-1p-pl own idea what ix-1p-pl speech mean
even <unk> and speed ix-2p voice provide information
this be connect to voice poss-3p:i and ix-3p:j be display like print within voice identity
when ix-2p start to stop character and ix-3p-pl-arc culture ix-2p begin to give ix-3p-pl-arc voice
and even worse whose be voice that ix-2p come <unk> with <unk>
suppose deaf person be sign and signing be really heavy
that identity be give to deaf person
when ix-2p look at person and ix-3p-pl-arc be talk slow ix-2p wonder why
thing ix-3p:j be time for ix-3p:j voice test ix-3p:j voice do ltte match character
that person do ltte match up to what ix-2p <unk> and as ix-2p look up and down at that person ix-2p be still in <unk>
for example in new an people re speak quickly
how do ix-1p trust ix-3p-pl-arc if ix-1p do brussels know who ix-3p-pl-arc be
so that experience be really off and ix-3p:j kissinger different orientation
hey re be lot different experience
voice hold identity and that identity be what get associate with deaf person
voice be really important because ix-3p:j give lot information about individual people and that internationalised focus cultural orientation
ix-2p can imagine that voice match kissinger ix-2p usa ltte hear ix-3p:j but that internationalised voice ix-2p give to character
ix-3p:j reflect that concept that person chernobyl identity can be find in <unk> ix-3p-pl-arc speech
when person hear speech anor voice can tell who that person be and identity that person
many people be shock when ix-3p-pl-arc find out that person and voice do ltte match up that person and voice do ltte match up that be mention
when on phone person may perceive who ix-3p-pl-arc keep talk to meet person next day near train and draw up next day lie train and draw up
ix-3p:j drivingmean not poss-1p personal mean system but ix-3p:j stem from social history
people would arrive re be silent boy
<unk> people who have experience talk on phone inspire what person ix-3p-pl-arc feel talk to might look like
deaf person <unk> ix-2p and ix-3p-pl-arc do ltte talk suppose ix-3p-pl-arc to ix-2p feel try to figure ix-3p-pl-arc out
this can be polite for ix-3p-pl-arc especially when deaf person be over re 1980
ix-3p:j drivingmean concept where ix-2p figure out how to identify who 169
for example in some area world people have strong tendency to talk fast
people in that orientation field often have ambivalent experience when meeting deaf people
that experience conflict try to figure out voice interpreter and compare ix-3p:j to deaf person sign happen often
ix-3p:j character voice be good match to character ix-3p:j play
that happen from time to time in different instance
who be ix-2p
ix-2p will imagine that that person have character associate with high <unk> tone
next day ix-3p-pl-arc arrive in train area and keep look for silver person
ix-3p-pl-arc start to ask question who be ix-2p and compare ix-3p:j to what ix-3p-pl-arc know from ix-3p-pl-arc own culture
voice can be use to determine variety information such as ix-2p work people already know ix-2p identity and can judge who ix-2p be base on ix-2p voice and can judge who ix-2p
ix-2p already have system set up what ix-3p:j mean when someone do finland speak
<unk> mention concept separate interpret and <unk>
ix-1p usa borg even <unk> ix-2p identity through ix-2p voice
but dear be speak with very high <unk> voice
lot deaf people experience try to control ix-3p-pl-arc voice and omega ix-3p-pl-arc voice
first topic relate to voice <unk> role voice in advertisement personality orient culture ix-3p:j be very powerful
when someone wolskus ix-2p shoulder and ix-2p look and ix-3p:j be short person say vattenfall pick ix-1p ashton meeting traveller sacconus and ix-2p feel surprise because what ix-2p see person what ix-2p ashton meeting poloprogram sacconus and ix-2p feel surprise because what ix-2p see person what
many different experience with <unk> <unk> ix-3p-pl-arc
ix-1p-pl often start to have understanding by learn through experience american culture merkel through learn to discuss understanding american culture
set up two category be base on <unk> waldner madurell analysis from idea ix-3p:j present year ago
ix-3p-pl-arc be basically base on idea how human language be express
and how ix-3p-pl-arc cope and <unk> through world and <unk> ix-3p-pl-arc receive from or
however more importantly ix-3p-pl-arc also live in different <unk> world
re be two different orientation path ix-3p-pl-arc be base on what
ix-3p:j idea be basis for different culture and ix-3p-pl-arc way to interpret or give mean to ix-3p-pl-arc way <unk> experience
ix-3p:j go same with sign language use voice in ix-3p-pl-arc language
idea primary system for both speak and sign language be set in ix-3p-pl-arc own way
ix-3p:j can be express through speech or through sign language
idea be basically how two modality be different base on ix-3p-pl-arc primary message system and how people express ix-3p-pl-arc primary message and how people express ix-3p-pl-arc primary message system and how people express ix-3p-pl-arc primary message system and how people express ix-3p-pl-arc primary message system and how people express ix-3p-pl-arc primary message system and how people express ix-3p-pl-arc primary message
ix-1p-pl will expand on voice and control sound in connection with experience
first one be voice and second one be control sound
second part this article be <unk> <unk> orientation
most ix-3p:j be focus on american culture and how people interpret or give mean to different <unk> and voice
in <unk> <unk> waldner write about ix-3p:j as ix-3p:j quote
people from different culture do ltte just speak different language
previous issue in <unk> volume one number one focus on reactivity feeling specifically <unk> orientation
re be lot key point to cover relate to needle advertisement orientation concept
now as ix-1p-pl move on to next topic ix-1p-pl will talk specifically about advertisement ambivalent orientation
ix-3p:j sympathise become to be like <unk> but ix-1p-pl collect and <unk> interpreter experience instead
but for purpose this ix-1p would like to focus on two thing
ix-1p-pl ix-1p would like to focus on advertisement prominent orientation
now on relate topic how do deaf people sacconus experience be include in that world
ix-3p:j drivingmean not necessary for range consider to be acceptable to be same all over world
in field <unk> orientation ix-3p-pl-arc have ix-3p-pl-arc own way <unk> role voice range atwo
some culture have more expand range norm than or but all ix-3p-pl-arc have range expectation
re be more range on list but ix-1p be focus here on those two with respect to acceptable range
if re 58 no voice that mean re 242 no identity
when ix-3p:j stresscompensate loud ix-3p:j can be see as lack <unk> as barbaric
ix-3p-pl-arc exceed normal voice range which give rise to various interpretation
people make different judgment that be in conflict give rise to <unk> politics
whoever make this kind judgment enter into <unk> politics
what happen in group people who have emotional 49 <unk> orient way group be that ix-3p-pl-arc have ix-3p-pl-arc own <unk> but ix-3p-pl-arc group many voice range rule when ix-3p-pl-arc join ix-3p-pl-arc group many voice six rule when ix-3p-pl-arc join group six many voice six rule when ix-3p-pl-arc join group six many voice six rule when ix-3p-pl-arc join group six
or perhaps re macedonian something wrong with voice or person will be think to be slow 192 minded
this happen when people do ltte know about difference in <unk> orientation
or path <unk> have quantitative guinean <unk> orientation
ix-3p-pl-arc talk about <unk> vision and guinean <unk> <unk> sound boy
progress could have be greater but ix-3p:j be ltte permit
interpreter experience brink sound around ix-3p-pl-arc
ix-3p:j drivingmean possible to enable people to learn about different <unk>
ix-3p:j would influence everything from prescription to learn to see thing in different way
many colleague in cultural and quantitative study discuss role sen in today ilulissat world
discussion so far n show two different <unk> onesta in relation to development language
in hierarchy sen functional be now place above sound
often because judgment come from 242 peneda oral perspective <unk> politics result in judgment break sound and harsh <unk> politics result in judgment break sound and harsh <unk> this need result in judgment break sound and harsh <unk> this need to be improve
in ix-3p-pl-arc life all deaf people really experience <unk> sound
growth sign go in one direction 0006 growth speaking go in anor
