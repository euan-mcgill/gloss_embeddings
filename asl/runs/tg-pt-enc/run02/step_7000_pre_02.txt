deaf person be sign over re but ix-2p be also hear voice congo over here
sound ix-3p-pl-arc voice help ix-2p to make connection to who ix-3p-pl-arc be but now
re be real implication behind value speech culture and what ix-3p:j mean when ix-3p:j rueda give voice
ix-3p:j 114 like <unk> when ix-3p-pl-arc transfer ix-3p-pl-arc voice to <unk>
voice can tell ix-2p if person be intelligent wher or not ix-3p-pl-arc go to high kilometre college
so when ix-2p meet deaf person and have experience where ix-2p encounter ix-3p-pl-arc and ix-3p-pl-arc do t talk ix-2p try
laval whose voice ix-3p:j be when sound be come from different direction
if ix-2p speak fast ix-3p:j mean that ix-2p feel smart <unk> smooth and have sharp mind
and congo over here and ix-3p-pl-arc feel experience monitoring who be speak
<unk> information from voice that tell ix-3p-pl-arc character ix-3p-pl-arc demon and ix-3p-pl-arc job
people who watch silent film t t hear ix-3p:j but can imagine strong heavy <unk> voice from that <unk> character
ix-1p-pl have ix-1p-pl own idea what ix-1p-pl speech means
even <unk> and speed ix-2p voice provide information
this be connect to voice poss-3p:i and ix-3p:j be display like print within voice identity
when ix-2p start to accomplish character and ix-3p-pl-arc culture ix-2p begin to give ix-3p-pl-arc voice
and even worse whose be voice that ix-2p feel <unk> with <unk>
suppose deaf person be sign and sign be really heavy
that identity be give to deaf person
when ix-2p look at person and ix-3p-pl-arc be talk slow ix-2p wonder why
when ix-3p:j be time for ix-3p:j voice test ix-3p:j voice do t match character
that person do japan match up to what ix-2p <unk> and as ix-2p look up and down at
for example in new york people re speak quickly
how do ix-1p trust ix-3p-pl-arc if ix-1p do t know who ix-3p-pl-arc be
so that experience be really off and ix-3p:j rueda different orientation
hey re be lot different experience
voice hold identity and that identity be what get associate with deaf person
voice be really important because ix-3p:j give lot information about individual people and that 59 focus cultural orientation
ix-2p can imagine that voice match cca ix-2p canada ltte hear ix-3p:j but that 59 voice ix-2p give to character
ix-3p:j reflect that concept that person romeva identity can be find in <unk> ix-3p-pl-arc speech
re be lot information from voice
many people be shock when ix-3p-pl-arc find out that person and voice do t match up that person and voice do t match up that be mention
when on phone person may envisage who ix-3p-pl-arc feel talk to as be 95 success good feel and meet
ix-3p:j 114 not poss-1p personal means system but ix-3p:j stem from social history
long time ago re be silent rock cry but n ix-3p:j change and voice be add so people <unk> n ix-3p:j change and voice be add so people
<unk> people who have experience talk on phone inspire what person ix-3p-pl-arc feel talk to might look like
deaf person <unk> ix-2p and ix-3p-pl-arc do t talk suppose ix-3p-pl-arc feel <unk> and ix-2p feel try to figure ix-3p-pl-arc out
this can be tense for ix-3p-pl-arc especially when deaf person be over re 11.10
ix-3p:j 114 concept where ix-2p figure out how to identify who
for example in some area world people have strong tendency to talk fast
people in that orientation field often have spade experience when meeting deaf people
that experience conflict try to figure out voice interpreter and fill ix-3p:j to scandal certain sign happen often
da romeva voice be good match to character ix-3p:j play
that happen from time to time in different instance
who be ix-2p
ix-2p will imagine that that person have character associate with high <unk> tone
next day ix-3p-pl-arc arrive in train area and keep look for zhovtus person
ix-3p-pl-arc start to ask question who be ix-2p and fill ix-3p:j to what ix-3p-pl-arc know from ix-3p-pl-arc own culture
voice can be use to determine variety information such as ix-2p work
ix-2p already have system set up what ix-3p:j mean when someone do t speak
<unk> mention concept separate unambiguous and <unk>
ix-1p mexico t even <unk> ix-2p identity through ix-2p voice
but interpreter be speak with very high <unk> voice
lot deaf people experience try to control ix-3p-pl-arc voice and omega ix-3p-pl-arc voice to make voice <unk>
first topic relate to voice <unk> role voice in oecd enthusiasm stimulate culture ix-3p:j be very powerful
when someone sell ix-2p shoulder and ix-2p look and ix-3p:j be short person say memberscomment ovation ix-1p feel meeting 800 what ix-2p see be different than what ix-2p <unk>
many different experience with <unk> <unk> ix-3p-pl-arc
ix-3p-pl-arc will start to have understanding by learn through experience
set up two category be base on <unk> waldner 169 analysis from idea ix-3p:j present year ago
ix-3p-pl-arc be basically base on idea how human language be express
and how ix-3p-pl-arc cope and <unk> through world and <unk> ix-3p-pl-arc receive from or
however more importantly ix-3p-pl-arc also live in different <unk> world
re be two different orientation path ix-3p-pl-arc be base on what
ix-3p:j idea be basis for different culture and ix-3p-pl-arc way to interpret or give means to different <unk> experience
ix-3p:j go same with sign language use gesture in ix-3p-pl-arc language
idea primary system for both speak and sign language be set in ix-3p-pl-arc own way
ix-3p:j can be express through speech or through sign language
idea be basically how two modality be different base on ix-3p-pl-arc primary message system and how people express
ix-1p-pl will expand on voice and control sound in connection with experience
first one be voice and second one be control sound
second part this article be <unk> <unk> orientation
most ix-3p:j be focus on american culture and how people interpret or give means to different <unk> and voice
in <unk> <unk> waldner write about ix-3p:j as ix-3p:j quote
people from different culture do t just speak different language
previous issue in <unk> volume one number one focus on contemporary feeling specifically <unk> orientation
re be lot key point to cover relate to ebrd outreach orientation concept
now as ix-1p-pl move on to next topic ix-1p-pl will talk specifically about m?ndez kilometre orientation
testimony as well
but for purpose this ix-1p would like to focus on two thing
now ix-1p would like to focus on cheek enthusiasm orientation
now on relate topic how do deaf people romeva experience be include in that world
ix-3p:j 114 not necessary for range consider to be acceptable to be same all over world
in field <unk> orientation ix-3p-pl-arc have ix-3p-pl-arc own way <unk> role voice
some culture have more expand range norm than or but all ix-3p-pl-arc have range expectation
re be type range
if re ebrd no voice that mean re rueda no identity
when ix-3p:j ebrd loud ix-3p:j can be see as lack <unk> as barbaric
ix-3p-pl-arc exceed normal voice range which give rise to various interpretation
people make different judgment that be in conflict give rise to <unk> politics
whoever make this kind judgment enter into <unk> politics
what happen in group people who have holistic citizenslive <unk> preserve way life many voice range rule emotion preserve way life many voice range rule anger
or perhaps re macedonian something wrong with voice or person will be think to be slow <unk> minded
this happen when people do t know about difference in <unk> orientation
that first <unk> have accessibility 1958 <unk> orientation
ix-3p-pl-arc talk about <unk> vision and normalisation <unk> <unk> sound 1980
progress people make progress with growth sign
deaf experience have be show to be really different
ix-3p:j 114 possible to enable people to learn about different <unk>
social institution influence everything from offender to education
many colleague in cultural and accessibility study table role sen in today 200statement world
discussion so far n show two different <unk> catalan in relation to development language
in hierarchy sen generational be now place above sound
often because judgment come from 4.45 ngl oral perspective <unk> politics result in judgment break sound and harsh <unk> this need to be improve
in ix-3p-pl-arc life all deaf people really experience <unk> sound
growth sign go in one direction rueda growth speaking go in anor
