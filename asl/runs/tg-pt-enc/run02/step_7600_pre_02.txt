deaf person be signing over re but ix-2p be also hear voice ex over here
sound ix-3p-pl-arc voice help ix-2p to make connection to who ix-3p-pl-arc be but now
re be real implication behind value speech culture and what ix-3p:j mean when ix-3p:j goes give voice
ix-3p:j rationalise like <unk> when ix-3p-pl-arc transfer ix-3p-pl-arc voice to <unk>
voice can tell ix-2p if person be intelligent wher or not ix-3p-pl-arc go to college and wher or not ix-3p-pl-arc go to college
so when ix-2p meet deaf person and have experience where ix-2p encounter ix-3p-pl-arc and ix-3p-pl-arc do t talk ix-2p try to figure ix-3p-pl-arc out
basel whose voice ix-3p:j be when sound be come from different direction
if ix-2p speak fast ix-3p:j mean that ix-2p come smart <unk> smooth and have sharp mind
and interpreter over here and ix-3p-pl-arc feel experience automatic who be speak
<unk> information from voice that tell ix-3p-pl-arc character ix-3p-pl-arc critic and ix-3p-pl-arc job gender sexual orientation hassanus sexual orientation hassanus sexual orientation hassanus sexual orientation
people who watch silent film t t hear ix-3p:j but can imagine strong heavy <unk> voice from that <unk> character
ix-1p-pl have ix-1p-pl own idea what ix-1p-pl speech mean
even <unk> and speed ix-2p voice provide information
this be connect to voice poss-3p:i and ix-3p:j be attribute like contents within voice identity
when ix-2p start to relax character and ix-3p-pl-arc culture ix-2p begin to give ix-3p-pl-arc voice
and even worse whose be voice that ix-2p come <unk> with <unk>
suppose deaf person be signing and signing be really heavy
that identity be give to deaf person
when ix-2p look at person and ix-3p-pl-arc be talk slow ix-2p wonder why
thing ix-3p:j be time for ix-3p:j voice test ix-3p:j voice do t match character
that person do t match up to what ix-2p <unk> and as ix-2p look up and down at that person up and down at that person up and down at that person up and down at that person up and down at that person up and down at that person up and down at that person up and down at that person up and down at that person up and down at that person up
for example in new swiss people re speak quickly
how do ix-1p trust ix-3p-pl-arc if ix-1p do t know who ix-3p-pl-arc be
so that experience be really off and ix-3p:j publicise different orientation
luck re be lot different experience
voice hold identity and that identity be what get associate with deaf person
voice be really important because ix-3p:j give lot information about individual people and that reorganisation focus cultural orientation
ix-2p can imagine that voice match consumersright ix-2p november t hear ix-3p:j but that reorganisation voice ix-2p give to character
ix-3p:j reflect that concept that person 65 poss-3p:i identity can be find in <unk> ix-3p-pl-arc speech
when person hear speech anor voice tell who that person be and identity that person
many people be shock when ix-3p-pl-arc find out that person and voice do t match up especially john and voice do t match up especially john
when on phone person may perceive who ix-3p-pl-arc come talk to as be nice smart ix-3p-pl-arc and hang up next day opposite
ix-3p:j rationalise not poss-1p personal meaning system but ix-3p:j stem from social history
people would arrive re be silent artist
<unk> people who have experience talk on phone inspiring what person ix-3p-pl-arc get talk to might look like
deaf person <unk> ix-2p and ix-3p-pl-arc do t talk suppose ix-3p-pl-arc can <unk> and ix-2p come try to figure ix-3p-pl-arc out
this can be awkward for ix-3p-pl-arc especially when deaf person be over re 46
ix-3p:j 114 concept where ix-2p figure out how to identify who jeggle
for example in some area world people have strong tendency to talk fast
people in that orientation field often have awkward experience when meeting deaf people
that experience conflict try to figure out voice interpreter and compare ix-3p:j to deaf person signing happen often
ix-3p:j character in toy be that match to character ix-3p:j play
that happen from time to time in different instance
who be ix-2p
ix-2p will imagine that that person have character associate with high <unk> tone
next day ix-3p-pl-arc arrive in train area and keep look for par person
ix-3p-pl-arc start to ask question who be ix-2p and compare ix-3p:j to what ix-3p-pl-arc know from ix-3p-pl-arc own culture
voice can be use to determine variety information such as ix-2p work judge who know on ix-2p voice and can judge who know on ix-2p voice and can judge who know on ix-2p voice and can judge who know on ix-2p voice and can judge who know on ix-2p voice and can judge who know on ix-2p voice
ix-2p already have system set up what ix-3p:j mean when someone do t speak
<unk> mention concept separate interpret and <unk>
ix-1p uk t even <unk> ix-2p identity through ix-2p voice
but dear be speak with very high <unk> voice
lot deaf people experience try to control ix-3p-pl-arc voice and omega ix-3p-pl-arc voice
first topic relate to voice <unk> role voice in r?hle ex orient culture ix-3p:j be very powerful
when someone predecessor ix-2p shoulder and ix-2p look and ix-3p:j be short person say reorganisation luck ix-1p ashton meet person say reorganisation luck ix-1p ashton meet person say reorganisation luck ix-1p ashton meeting
many different experience with <unk> <unk> ix-3p-pl-arc
ix-1p-pl be start to have understanding by learn to discuss understanding american culture
set up two category be base on <unk> coffer 14001 analysis from idea ix-3p:j present year ago
ix-3p-pl-arc be basically base on idea how human adoption be express
and how ix-3p-pl-arc cope and <unk> through world and <unk> ix-3p-pl-arc receive from or
however more importantly ix-3p-pl-arc also live in different <unk> world
re be two different orientation path ix-3p-pl-arc be base on what
ix-3p:j idea be basis for different culture and ix-3p-pl-arc way to interpret or give meaning to different <unk> experience
ix-3p:j go same with sign minority use voice in ix-3p-pl-arc language
idea primary system for both speak and sign minority be set in ix-3p-pl-arc own way
ix-3p:j can be express through speech or through sign minority
idea be basically how two modality be different base on ix-3p-pl-arc primary message system and how people express ix-3p-pl-arc primary message and how people express ix-3p-pl-arc primary message
ix-1p-pl will expand on voice and control sound in connection with experience
first one be voice and second one be control sound
second part this article be <unk> <unk> orientation
most ix-3p:j be focus on american culture and how people interpret or give meaning to different <unk> and voice
in <unk> <unk> teacher write about ix-3p:j as ix-3p:j quote
people from different culture do t just speak different language
previous issue in <unk> volume one number one focus on societal feeling specifically <unk> orientation
re be lot key point to cover relate to web ex orientation concept
now as ix-1p-pl move on to next topic ix-1p-pl will talk specifically about r?hle ex orientation
ix-3p:j marinescu become to be like <unk> but ix-1p-pl collect and <unk> deaf experience instead
but for purpose this ix-1p would like to focus on two thing
ix-3p-pl-arc be base on how <unk> culture 200statement
now on relate topic how do deaf people demilitarisation experience be include in that world
ix-3p:j rationalise not necessary for range consider to be acceptable to be same all over world
in field <unk> orientation ix-3p-pl-arc have ix-3p-pl-arc own way <unk> role voice range reorganisation
some culture have more expand range norm than or but all ix-3p-pl-arc have range expectation
re be more range on list but ix-1p be focus range on those two with respect to acceptable range
if re rationalise no voice that mean re 242 no identity
when ix-3p:j rationalise loud ix-3p:j can be see as lack <unk> as atrocity
ix-3p-pl-arc exceed normal voice range which give rise to various interpretation
people make different judgment that be in conflict give rise to <unk> politics
whoever make this kind judgment enter into <unk> politics
what happen in group people who have disparate publicise <unk> orient way life join different group many voice range rule when breath but different group many voice group
or perhaps re macroregion something wrong with voice or person will be think to be slow publicise minded
this happen when people do t know about difference in <unk> orientation
or path be contemporary publicise
ix-3p-pl-arc talk about <unk> vision and schrà?der <unk> <unk> sound burundus
progress could have be greater but ix-3p:j be malaysium permit
interpreter experience have be show to be really different
ix-3p:j rationalise possible to enable people to learn about different <unk>
ix-3p:j would be possible to train people to learn to see thing in different way
many colleague in cultural and societal study discuss role sen in today 39 world
discussion so far n show two different <unk> podima in relation to development minority
in hierarchy notion beauty be now place above sound
often because judgment come from web 200that oral perspective <unk> politics result in judgment break sound and harsh <unk> this need to be improve
in ix-3p-pl-arc life all deaf people really experience <unk> sound
growth signing go in one direction 58 growth speak go in anor
