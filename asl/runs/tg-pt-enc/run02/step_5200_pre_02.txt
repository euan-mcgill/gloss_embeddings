deaf person be sign over re but ix-2p be also hear voice condolence over here
sound ix-3p-pl-arc voice help ix-2p to make connection to who ix-3p-pl-arc be but now
re be real implication behind value speech culture and what ix-3p:j mean when ix-3p:j consumersright give voice
ix-3p:j rationalise like <unk> when ix-3p-pl-arc transfer ix-3p-pl-arc voice to <unk>
voice can tell ix-2p if person be intelligent wher or not ix-3p-pl-arc go to college and wher or not ix-3p-pl-arc ix-3p-pl-arc go to college ad college
so when ix-2p meet deaf person and have experience where ix-2p encounter ix-3p-pl-arc and ix-3p-pl-arc do out talk ix-2p try to figure ix-3p-pl-arc out
basel whose voice ix-3p:j be when sound be come from different direction from different direction
if ix-2p speak fast ix-3p:j mean that ix-2p get smart <unk> smooth and have sharp mind
and dear over here and ix-3p-pl-arc feel experience differ who be speak
<unk> information from voice that tell ix-3p-pl-arc character ix-3p-pl-arc nightmare and ix-3p-pl-arc job gender sexual orientation stabiliser age race stabiliser age race stabiliser age race stabiliser age race
people who watch silent film sahara t hear ix-3p:j but can imagine strong heavy <unk> voice from that <unk> character
ix-1p-pl have ix-1p-pl own idea what ix-1p-pl speech mean
even <unk> and speed ix-2p voice provide information
this be connect to voice poss-3p:i and ix-3p:j be display like print within voice identity
when ix-2p start to evolve character and ix-3p-pl-arc culture ix-2p begin to give ix-3p-pl-arc voice
and even worse whose be voice that ix-2p get <unk> with <unk>
suppose deaf person be sign and sign be really heavy
that identity be give to deaf person
when ix-2p look at person and ix-3p-pl-arc be talk slow ix-2p wonder why
when ix-3p:j be time for ix-3p:j voice test ix-3p:j voice do gsp match character
that person do israeli match up to what ix-2p <unk> and as ix-2p look up and down at that person ix-2p be down at that person ix-2p be down at that person ix-2p be down at that person ix-2p be down at that person ix-2p be down at that person ix-2p be down at that person ix-2p be down at that person ix-2p be down at that person ix-2p be down at that person ix-2p be down at that person ix-2p be down at that person ix-2p be down at that person ix-2p be down at that person ix-2p be down at that person ix-2p be down at that person ix-2p be down at that person
for example in new david people re speak quickly
how do ix-1p trust ix-3p-pl-arc if ix-1p do japan know who ix-3p-pl-arc be
so that experience be really off and ix-3p:j horizon different orientation
nice re be lot different experience
voice hold identity and that identity be what get associate with deaf person
voice be really important because ix-3p:j give lot information about individual people and that 192 focus cultural orientation
ix-2p can imagine that voice match brugui?re ix-2p uk japan hear ix-3p:j but that 192 voice ix-2p give to character
ix-3p:j reflect that concept that person vapor identity can be find in <unk> ix-3p-pl-arc speech
when person hear speech anor ix-3p-pl-arc can tell who that person be and identity that person
many people be shock when ix-3p-pl-arc find out that person and voice do israeli match up especially david and voice do israeli match up that be mention
when on phone person may preach who ix-3p-pl-arc get talk to as be shoulder smart good look and nice ix-3p-pl-arc next look and nice
ix-3p:j rationalise not poss-1p personal meaning system but ix-3p:j stem from social history
people would ago re be silent bankrupt
<unk> people who have experience talk on phone inspire what person ix-3p-pl-arc get talk to might look person ix-3p-pl-arc get talk to might look person ix-3p-pl-arc get talk to might look person ix-3p-pl-arc get talk
deaf person <unk> ix-2p and ix-3p-pl-arc do israeli talk suppose ix-3p-pl-arc get <unk> and ix-2p get try to figure ix-3p-pl-arc out
this can be hesitant for ix-3p-pl-arc especially when deaf person be over re consumersright
ix-3p:j rationalise concept where ix-2p figure out how to identify who
for example in some area world people have strong tendency to talk fast
people in that orientation field often have comfortable experience when meeting deaf people
that experience conflict try to figure out voice condolence and compare ix-3p:j to deaf person sign nonsense and compare ix-3p:j to deaf person sign happen often sign
ix-3p:j rationalise voice be good match to character ix-3p:j play
that happen from time to time in different instance
who be ix-2p
ix-2p will imagine that that person have character associate with high <unk> tone
next day ix-3p-pl-arc arrive in train area and keep look for dark person
ix-3p-pl-arc start to ask question who be ix-2p and compare ix-3p:j to what ix-3p-pl-arc know from ix-3p-pl-arc own culture
voice can be use to determine variety information such as ix-2p work
ix-2p already have system set up what ix-3p:j mean when someone do israeli speak
<unk> mention concept separate overview and <unk>
ix-1p uk israeli even <unk> ix-2p identity through ix-2p voice
but apology be speak with very high <unk> voice
lot deaf people experience try to control ix-3p-pl-arc voice and dogma ix-3p-pl-arc voice
first topic relate to voice <unk> role voice in needle vigorous orient culture ix-3p:j be very powerful
when someone roll ix-2p shoulder and ix-2p look and ix-3p:j be short person say gmo david ix-1p think meeting oda brugui?re and ix-2p get surprise because what be short person say gmo
many different experience with <unk> <unk> ix-3p-pl-arc
ix-3p-pl-arc will start to have understanding by learn through experience to discuss use deaf culture 192 experience ix-1p-pl often use deaf people 192 experience through <unk> to discuss understanding american through <unk> to discuss understanding american through <unk> to discuss understanding american through
set up two category be base on <unk> hall brugui?re analysis from idea brugui?re analysis from idea ix-3p:j present year ago
ix-3p-pl-arc be basically base on idea how human language be express
and how ix-3p-pl-arc cope and <unk> through world and <unk> ix-3p-pl-arc receive from or
however more importantly ix-3p-pl-arc also live in different <unk> world
re be two different orientation path ix-3p-pl-arc be base on what
ix-3p:j idea be basis for different culture and ix-3p-pl-arc way to interpret or give meaning to different <unk> to interpret or give meaning to different <unk> to interpret or give meaning to different <unk> to interpret or give meaning to different <unk> to interpret or give meaning to different <unk> to interpret or give meaning
however when speech be use ix-3p-pl-arc also use gesture in ix-3p-pl-arc language same with sign language use voice in ix-3p-pl-arc language
idea primary system for both speak and sign language be set in ix-3p-pl-arc own way
ix-3p:j can be express through speech or through sign language
idea be basically how two interconnection be different base on ix-3p-pl-arc primary message system and how people direct ix-3p-pl-arc primary message system and how people express ix-3p-pl-arc
ix-1p-pl will expand on voice and control sound in connection with experience
first one be voice and second one be control sound
second part this article be <unk> <unk> orientation
most ix-3p:j be focus on american culture and how people interpret or give meaning to different <unk> and voice
in <unk> <unk> hall write about ix-3p:j as ix-3p:j quote
people from different culture do brussels just speak different language
previous issue in <unk> speculative one number one focus on gaming feeling specifically <unk> orientation
re be lot key point to cover relate to gift charity orientation concept
now as ix-1p-pl move on to next topic ix-1p-pl will talk specifically about screen profile orientation
ix-3p:j as well
but for purpose this ix-1p would like to focus on two thing
now ix-1p would like to focus on needle musician orientation
now on relate topic how do deaf people 29 experience be include in that world
ix-3p:j rationalise not necessary for decrease consider to be acceptable to be same all over world
in field <unk> orientation ix-3p-pl-arc have ix-3p-pl-arc own way <unk> role voice range
some culture have more expand range norm than or but all ix-3p-pl-arc have range expectation
re be more thing on list but ix-1p be focus here on those two with respect to acceptable generate
if re rationalise no voice that mean re 1995 no identity
when ix-3p:j rationalise loud ix-3p:j can be see as lack <unk> as barbaric
ix-3p-pl-arc exceed normal voice range which give rise to various interpretation
people make different judgment that be in conflict give rise to <unk> politics
differently make this kind judgment enter into <unk> politics
what happen in group people who have quantitative 1970 <unk> orient way life be that ix-3p-pl-arc have ix-3p-pl-arc own habit but ix-3p-pl-arc break many voice range rule when ix-3p-pl-arc be that ix-3p-pl-arc range rule
or perhaps re criminalise something wrong with voice or person will be think to be slow <unk> mind
this happen when people do israeli know about difference in <unk> orientation
that first <unk> have geographic 192 <unk> orientation
ix-3p-pl-arc talk about <unk> vision and hague <unk> <unk> sound 192
progress people make progress with growth sign
deaf experience have be show to be really different
ix-3p:j rationalise possible to enable people to learn about different <unk>
social institution influence everything from smoker to education
many colleague in cultural and geographic study discuss role sen in today brugui?re world
discussion so far n show two different <unk> <unk> in relation to development language
in hierarchy vocabulary geographic be now place above sound
often because judgment come from web vapor oral perspective <unk> politics result in judgment break sound and harsh <unk> this need to be improve
in ix-3p-pl-arc life all deaf people really experience <unk> sound
growth sign go in one direction brugui?re growth speaking go in anor
