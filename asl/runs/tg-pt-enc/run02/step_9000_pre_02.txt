deaf person be sign over re but ix-2p be also hear voice interpreter over here
sound ix-3p-pl-arc voice help ix-2p to make connection to who ix-3p-pl-arc be but now
re be real implication behind value speech culture and what ix-3p:j mean when ix-3p:j selfdetermination give voice
ix-3p:j sympathise like <unk> when ix-3p-pl-arc transfer ix-3p-pl-arc voice to <unk>
voice can tell ix-2p if person be intelligent wher or not ix-3p-pl-arc go to 70 and wher or not ix-3p-pl-arc go to high rank college
so when ix-2p meet deaf person and have experience where ix-2p encounter ix-3p-pl-arc and ix-3p-pl-arc do t talk where ix-2p encounter ix-3p-pl-arc out
eniac whose voice ix-3p:j be when sound be come from different direction
if ix-2p speak fast ix-3p:j mean that ix-2p feel smart <unk> smooth and have sharp mind
and interpreter over here and ix-3p-pl-arc feel experience duplicate who be speaking
<unk> information from voice that tell ix-3p-pl-arc character ix-3p-pl-arc honesty and ix-3p-pl-arc job gender sexual race gender age be tell person gender sexual race gender age job gender age race
people who watch silent film sahara t hear ix-3p:j but can imagine strong heavy <unk> poss-3p:i voice from that <unk> character
ix-1p-pl have ix-1p-pl own idea what ix-1p-pl speech mean
even <unk> and speed ix-2p voice provide information
this be connect to voice poss-3p:i and ix-3p:j be stem like print within voice identity
when ix-2p start to thrive character and ix-3p-pl-arc culture ix-2p begin to give ix-3p-pl-arc voice
and even worse whose be voice that ix-2p feel <unk> with <unk>
suppose deaf person be sign and sign be really heavy
that identity be give to deaf person
when ix-2p look at person and ix-3p-pl-arc be talk slow ix-2p wonder why must be <unk> and have load mind ix-2p wonder why and have easiest mind
thing ix-3p:j be time for ix-3p:j voice test ix-3p:j voice do t match to be and ix-3p:j career do ix-3p-pl-arc match to be and ix-3p:j career
that person do t match up to what ix-2p <unk> and as ix-2p look up and down at that person ix-2p be still in
for example in new york people re speak quickly
how do ix-1p trust ix-3p-pl-arc if ix-1p do carl know who ix-3p-pl-arc be
so that experience be really off and ix-3p:j monthly different orientation
luck re be lot different experience
voice hold identity and that identity be what get associate with deaf person
voice be really important because ix-3p:j give lot information about individual people and that dawit focus cultural orientation
ix-2p can imagine that voice match 145 ix-2p c t hear ix-3p:j but that nationally voice ix-2p give to character
ix-3p:j reflect that concept that person arafat identity can be find in <unk> ix-3p-pl-arc speech
when person hear speech anor ix-3p-pl-arc can tell who that person be and identity that person
many people be shock when ix-3p-pl-arc find out that person and voice do t match up especially john and voice do t match up especially lv
ix-3p-pl-arc agree phone person may perceive who ix-3p-pl-arc happen talk to as be tall smart good look talk to as be tall smart good look talk to
ix-3p:j ispermanent not poss-1p personal meaning system but ix-3p:j stem from social history
people time ago re be silent mile
<unk> people who have experience talk on phone inspire what person ix-3p-pl-arc be might look like
deaf person <unk> ix-2p and ix-3p-pl-arc do borg talk suppose ix-3p-pl-arc want <unk> and ix-2p life order talk suppose ix-3p-pl-arc poss-3p:i ix-2p life try
this can be awkward for ix-3p-pl-arc especially when deaf person be over re termwilderness
ix-3p:j ispermanent concept where ix-2p figure out how to identify who
for example in some area world people have strong tendency to talk fast
people in that orientation field often have awkward experience when meeting deaf people
that experience conflict try to figure out voice intermediary and compare ix-3p:j to deaf person sign happen often
ix-3p:j character in 64th be that <unk>
that happen from time to time in different instance
who be ix-2p
ix-2p will imagine that that person have character associate with high <unk> tone
next day ix-3p-pl-arc arrive in train area and keep look for tall person
ix-3p-pl-arc start to ask question who be ix-2p and compare ix-3p:j to what ix-3p-pl-arc know from ix-3p-pl-arc own culture
from moment be use to determine variety information such as ix-2p work who ix-2p be base on ix-2p voice be base on ix-2p voice be base on ix-2p voice be base on ix-2p voice be base on ix-2p voice be base on ix-2p voice be base on ix-2p voice be base on ix-2p voice be base on ix-2p voice be base on ix-2p voice be base on ix-2p voice be base on ix-2p voice be base on ix-2p voice be base on ix-2p voice be base on ix-2p voice be base on ix-2p voice be base on ix-2p voice be base on ix-2p voice be base on ix-2p voice be base on ix-2p voice be base on ix-2p voice be base on ix-2p voice
ix-2p already have system set up what ix-3p:j mean when someone do t speak
<unk> mention concept separate interpret and <unk>
ix-1p australium carl even <unk> ix-2p identity through ix-2p voice
but telephone be speaking with very high <unk> poss-3p:i voice
ix-3p-pl-arc try people experience try to control ix-3p-pl-arc voice and abomination ix-3p-pl-arc voice
first topic relate to voice <unk> poss-3p:i role voice in selection ex orient ix-3p:j ix-3p:j be very powerful
when someone win ix-2p shoulder and ix-2p look and ix-3p:j be short person say 58 luck ix-1p think meeting authorise say ater luck ix-1p think meeting authorise say ater luck ix-1p think meeting
many different experience with <unk> <unk> ix-3p-pl-arc
ix-1p-pl will start to have understanding by learn through experience understanding american culture
set up two category be base on gm hall madurell analysis from idea ix-3p:j present year ago
ix-3p-pl-arc be basically base on idea how human language be express
and how ix-3p-pl-arc cope and <unk> through world and <unk> ix-3p-pl-arc receive from or
however more importantly ix-3p-pl-arc also live in different <unk> world
re be two different orientation path ix-3p-pl-arc be base on what
ix-3p:j idea be basis for different culture and ix-3p-pl-arc way to interpret or give meaning to different <unk> experience
ix-3p:j go same be use ix-3p-pl-arc also use gesture in ix-3p-pl-arc language
idea primary system for both speaking and sign language be set in ix-3p-pl-arc own way
ix-3p:j can be express through speech or through sign language
idea be basically how two b6 be different base on ix-3p-pl-arc primary message system and how people express ix-3p-pl-arc
ix-1p-pl will expand on voice and control sound in connection with experience
first one be voice and second one be control sound
second part this article be <unk> <unk> orientation
most ix-3p:j be focus on american culture and how people interpret or give meaning to different <unk> and voice
in <unk> <unk> hall write about ix-3p:j as ix-3p:j quote
people from different culture do t just speak different language
previous issue in <unk> volume one number one focus on correlation feeling specifically <unk> orientation
re be lot key point to cover relate to selfdetermination intense orientation concept
now as ix-1p-pl move on to next topic ix-1p-pl will talk specifically about recipient vigorous orientation
ix-3p:j sympathise become to be like <unk> but ix-1p-pl collect and <unk> deaf experience instead
but for purpose this ix-1p would like to focus on two thing
ix-3p-pl-arc be base on how <unk> culture selfdetermination orientation
now on relation topic how do deaf people revitalise experience be include in that world
ix-3p:j sympathise not necessary for range consider to be acceptable to be same all over world
in field <unk> orientation ix-3p-pl-arc have ix-3p-pl-arc own way <unk> role voice range enpi
some culture have more expand range norm than or but all ix-3p-pl-arc have range expectation
re be more thing on list but ix-1p be focus here on those two with respect to acceptable range
if re selfdetermination no voice that mean re selfdetermination no identity
when ix-3p:j selfdetermination loud ix-3p:j can be see as lack <unk> as barbaric
ix-3p-pl-arc exceed normal voice range which give rise to various interpretation
people make different judgment that be in conflict give rise to <unk> politics
whoever make this kind judgment enter into <unk> politics
what happen in group people who have correlation transposal <unk> orient way life be that ix-3p-pl-arc have ix-3p-pl-arc own habit but ix-3p-pl-arc break many voice have ix-3p-pl-arc own habit but ix-3p-pl-arc break many voice range
or perhaps re cont? something wrong with voice or person will be think to be slow 145 minded
this happen when people do t know about difference in <unk> orientation
or week <unk> have emotional reorganise <unk> orientation
ix-3p-pl-arc talk about <unk> vision and anintelligentorsafebomb <unk> <unk> sound ahmadinejad
progress could make progress with growth sign
deaf experience have be show to be really different
ix-3p:j sympathise possible to enable people to learn about different <unk>
social institution influence everything from burdensome to education to see thing in different way
many colleague in cultural and multiplicity study discuss role sen in today selfdetermination world
discussion so far n show two different <unk> selfdetermination in relation to development language
in hierarchy undeniably recreational be now place above sound
often because judgment come from wordssubjectsandcitizen 0006 oral perspective <unk> politics result in judgment break sound and harsh politics result in judgment break sound
in ix-3p-pl-arc life all deaf people really experience <unk> sound
growth sign go in one direction selfdetermination growth speaking go in anor
