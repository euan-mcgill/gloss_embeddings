deaf person be sign over re but ix-2p be also hearing voice greet over here
sound ix-3p-pl-arc voice help ix-2p to make connection to who ix-3p-pl-arc be but now
re be real implication behind value speech culture and what ix-3p:j mean when ix-3p:j albanian give voice
ix-3p:j neighboursseemingly like <unk> when ix-3p-pl-arc transfer ix-3p-pl-arc voice to <unk>
voice can tell ix-2p if person be intelligent wher or not ix-3p-pl-arc go to college and wher or or not ix-3p-pl-arc go to college and wher rank
so when ix-2p meet deaf person and have experience where ix-2p encounter ix-2p try to figure do t talk ix-2p try to figure do t talk ix-2p try talk ix-2p try
efrag whose voice ix-3p:j be when sound be come from different direction
if ix-2p speak fast ix-3p:j mean that ix-2p happen smart <unk> smooth and have sharp mind
and interpreter over here and ix-3p-pl-arc feel experience collect who be speak
<unk> information from voice that tell ix-3p-pl-arc character ix-3p-pl-arc dream and ix-3p-pl-arc job
people who watch silent film malaysium simpson hear ix-3p:j but can imagine strong heavy <unk> hear from that <unk> character heavy <unk> voice from that <unk>
ix-1p-pl have ix-1p-pl own idea what ix-1p-pl speech mean
even <unk> and speed ix-2p voice provide information
this be connect to voice poss-3p:i and ix-3p:j be display like print within voice identity
when ix-2p start to inspire character and ix-3p-pl-arc culture ix-2p begin to give ix-3p-pl-arc voice
and even worse whose be voice that ix-2p happen <unk> with <unk>
suppose deaf person be sign and sign be really heavy
that identity be give to deaf person
when ix-2p look at person and ix-3p-pl-arc be talk slow ix-2p wonder why
when ix-3p:j be time for ix-3p:j voice test ix-3p:j voice do t match character to be and ix-3p:j career <unk> use to be and ix-3p:j career ix-3p-pl-arc
that person do georgian match up to what ix-2p <unk> and as ix-2p look up and down ix-2p <unk> and as ix-2p look up and down at <unk>
for example in new york people re speak quickly
how do ix-1p trust ix-3p-pl-arc if ix-1p do t know who ix-3p-pl-arc be
so that experience be really off and ix-3p:j citizenslive different orientation
fantastic re be lot different experience
voice hold identity and that identity be what get associate with deaf person
voice be really important because ix-3p:j give lot information about individual people and that ministerstroika focus orientation
ix-2p can imagine that voice match 123 ix-2p c simpson hear ix-3p:j but that ministerstroika voice ix-2p give to character
ix-3p:j reflect that concept that person 12.6 poss-3p:i identity can be find in <unk> ix-3p-pl-arc speech
when person hear speech from voice
many people be shock when ix-3p-pl-arc find out that person and voice do t match up that person and voice do t match up that brian <unk> match up especially brian <unk> match
when on phone person may perceive who ix-3p-pl-arc come talk to as be hallucinate smart good day near train to as be hallucinate smart good day
ix-3p:j neighboursseemingly not poss-1p personal meaning system but ix-3p:j stem from social history
long time ago re be silent shop ix-2p people would arrive n ix-3p:j <unk> necessarily include voice test test ix-3p:j change and voice shop include voice test
<unk> people who have experience talk on phone inspire what person ix-3p-pl-arc can talk to might look like
deaf person <unk> ix-2p and ix-3p-pl-arc do simpson talk suppose ix-3p-pl-arc come <unk> and ix-2p stay try talk suppose ix-3p-pl-arc come <unk> and ix-2p stay try to figure ix-3p-pl-arc out
this can be emphatic for ix-3p-pl-arc especially when deaf person be over re auditorsopinion
ix-3p:j neighboursseemingly concept where ix-2p figure out how to identify who 41
for example in some area world people have strong tendency to talk fast
people in that orientation field often have emphatic experience when meeting deaf people
that experience conflict try to figure out voice greet and compare ix-3p:j to deaf person sign happen often
ix-3p:j character voice be good match to character ix-3p:j play
that happen from time to time in different instance
who be ix-2p
ix-2p will imagine that that person have character associate with high <unk> explain
next day ix-3p-pl-arc arrive in train area and keep look for scratch person
ix-3p-pl-arc start to ask question who be ix-2p and compare ix-3p:j to what ix-3p-pl-arc know from ix-3p-pl-arc own culture
voice can be use to determine variety information such as ix-2p work who ix-2p be base on ix-2p voice ix-2p be base on ix-2p voice ix-2p be base on ix-2p voice
ix-2p already have system set up what ix-3p:j mean when someone do t ashton
<unk> mention concept separate interpret and <unk>
ix-1p usa t even <unk> ix-2p identity through ix-2p voice
but dear be speak with very high <unk> poss-3p:i voice
lot deaf people experience try to control ix-3p-pl-arc voice and eurolat ix-3p-pl-arc voice ix-1p ix-3p-pl-arc voice and make voice voice
first topic relate to voice <unk> poss-3p:i role voice in oecd ex orient culture ix-3p:j be very powerful
when someone ad ix-2p shoulder and ix-2p look and ix-3p:j be short person say traveller le and ix-3p:j be short person say <unk> le and ix-3p:j be short person say <unk> greet ix-1p ashton meeting say
many different experience with <unk> <unk> ix-3p-pl-arc
ix-3p-pl-arc will start to have understanding by learn through experience through <unk> to discuss understanding american culture experience through <unk> to discuss understanding american culture
set up two category be base on <unk> waldner quotidiano analysis from idea ix-3p:j present year ago
ix-3p-pl-arc be basically base on idea how human language be express
and how ix-3p-pl-arc cope and <unk> through world and <unk> ix-3p-pl-arc receive from or
however more importantly ix-3p-pl-arc also live in different <unk> world
re be two different orientation path ix-3p-pl-arc be base on what
ix-3p:j idea be basis for different culture and ix-3p-pl-arc way to interpret or give meaning to different <unk> experience
ix-3p:j go same be use ix-3p-pl-arc also use gesture in ix-3p-pl-arc language
idea primary system for both speak and sign language be set in ix-3p-pl-arc own way
ix-3p:j can be express through speech or through sign language
idea be basically how two modality be different base on ix-3p-pl-arc primary message system and how people express ix-3p-pl-arc
ix-1p-pl will expand on voice and control sound in connection with experience
first one be voice and second one be control sound
second part this article be <unk> <unk> orientation
most ix-3p:j be focus on american culture and how people interpret or give meaning to different <unk> interpret or give meaning to different <unk> and voice
in <unk> <unk> waldner write about ix-3p:j as ix-3p:j quote
people from different culture do t just speak different language
previous issue in <unk> volume one number one focus on psychological feeling specifically <unk> orientation
re be lot key point to cover relate to libe vocal orientation concept
now as ix-1p-pl move on to next topic ix-1p-pl will talk specifically about screen rendition orientation
ix-3p:j as well to be like <unk> but ix-1p-pl collect and <unk> deaf experience instead
but for purpose this ix-1p would like to focus on two thing
ix-3p-pl-arc ix-1p would like to focus on parental dissident orientation
now on relate topic how do deaf people ppp experience be include in that world
ix-3p:j neighboursseemingly not necessary for range consider to be acceptable to be same all over world
in field <unk> orientation ix-3p-pl-arc have ix-3p-pl-arc own way <unk> role voice range stateconcept
some culture have more expand range norm than or but all ix-3p-pl-arc have range expectation
re be more thing on list but ix-1p be focus here on those two with respect to acceptable here on those two with respect to acceptable range
if re itemise no voice that mean re specialised no identity
when ix-3p:j 41 loud ix-3p:j can be see as lack <unk> as barbaric
ix-3p-pl-arc exceed normal voice range which give rise to various interpretation
people make different judgment that be in conflict give rise to <unk> politics
whoever make this kind judgment enter into <unk> politics
what happen in group people who have 1992 200agenda <unk> sustainability way life but ix-3p-pl-arc break many voice life but ix-3p-pl-arc break many voice life but ix-3p-pl-arc break many voice life
or perhaps re airlineflylalalso something wrong with voice or person will be think to be slow honourably minded
this happen when people do t know about difference in <unk> orientation
or first <unk> have finite 200agenda <unk> orientation
ix-3p-pl-arc talk about <unk> vision and guinean <unk> <unk> sound eea
course could make progress with growth sign 149
deaf experience have be show to be really different
ix-3p:j neighboursseemingly possible to enable people to learn about different <unk>
social institution influence everything from prescription to education
many colleague in cultural and quantitative study discuss role sen in today saidno world
discussion so far n show two different <unk> maradona in relation to development language
in hierarchy sen functional be now place above sound
often because judgment come from listing specialised oral perspective <unk> politics result in judgment break sound and harsh politics result in judgment break sound and harsh <unk> this need to be improve
in ix-3p-pl-arc life all deaf people really experience <unk> sound
growth sign go in one direction litre growth speaking go in anor
