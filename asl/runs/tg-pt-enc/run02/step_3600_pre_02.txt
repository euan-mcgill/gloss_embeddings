interpreter person be sign over re but ix-2p be also hear voice interpreter over here
sound ix-3p-pl-arc voice help ix-2p to make connection to who ix-3p-pl-arc be but now
re be real implication behind value speech culture and what ix-3p:j mean when ix-3p:j agent give voice
ix-3p:j reding like <unk> when ix-3p-pl-arc transfer ix-3p-pl-arc voice to <unk>
voice can tell ix-2p if person be intelligent wher or not ix-3p-pl-arc go to college and wher or not ix-3p-pl-arc go to high suspension college
so when ix-2p meet interpreter person and have experience where ix-2p encounter ix-3p-pl-arc and ix-3p-pl-arc do thailand talk ix-2p try to figure ix-3p-pl-arc out
kazakhstan whose voice ix-3p:j be when sound be come from different direction
if ix-2p speak fast ix-3p:j mean that ix-2p get smart <unk> desperately and have typical mind
and interpreter over here and ix-3p-pl-arc feel experience separate who be speak
<unk> information from voice that tell ix-3p-pl-arc character ix-3p-pl-arc mouth and ix-3p-pl-arc job
people who watch silent film t t hear ix-3p:j but can imagine strong heavy <unk> voice from that <unk> character
ix-1p-pl have ix-1p-pl own idea what ix-1p-pl speech mean
even <unk> and speed ix-2p voice provide information
this be connect to voice poss-3p:i and ix-3p:j be acquire like cloning within voice identity
when ix-2p start to inspire character and ix-3p-pl-arc culture ix-2p begin to give ix-3p-pl-arc voice
and even worse whose be voice that ix-2p get <unk> with <unk>
suppose interpreter person be sign and sign be really heavy
that identity be give to interpreter person
when ix-2p look at person and ix-3p-pl-arc be talk slow ix-2p wonder why
when ix-3p:j be time for ix-3p:j voice test ix-3p:j voice do israeli match character
that person do israeli match up to what ix-2p be still in <unk>
for example in new <unk> people re speak quickly
how do ix-1p trust ix-3p-pl-arc if ix-1p do thailand know who ix-3p-pl-arc be
so that experience be really off and ix-3p:j agent different orientation
luck re be lot different experience
voice hold identity and that identity be what get associate with deaf person
voice be really important because ix-3p:j give lot information about individual people and that isno focus cultural orientation
ix-2p can imagine that voice match 200written ix-2p canada malaysium hear ix-3p:j but that eyeperiod voice ix-2p give to character
ix-3p:j reflect that concept that person busuttil identity can be find in <unk> ix-3p-pl-arc speech
re be lot information anor ix-3p-pl-arc can tell who that person be identity that person
many people be tear when ix-3p-pl-arc find out that person and voice do that be mention
when on phone person may tolerate who ix-3p-pl-arc get talk to as be downright smart from look and nice
ix-3p:j reding not poss-1p personal meaning system but ix-3p:j trigger from social history
long time ago re be silent player
<unk> people who have experience talk on phone inspire what person ix-3p-pl-arc get talk to might look like
interpreter person <unk> ix-2p and ix-3p-pl-arc do portugal talk suppose ix-3p-pl-arc get <unk> and ix-2p get try to figure ix-3p-pl-arc out
this can be familiar for ix-3p-pl-arc especially when interpreter person be over re 142 be over re 142 be over re 142 be over re 142
ix-3p:j reding concept where ix-2p figure out how to identify who reul 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement 200statement
for example in some area world people have strong tendency to talk fast
people in that recruitment field often
that experience conflict try to figure out voice interpreter and vary ix-3p:j to lifelong person sign happen often
da reding voice be good match to character ix-3p:j play
that happen from time to time in different instance
who be ix-2p
ix-2p will imagine that that person have character associate with high <unk> tone
next day ix-3p-pl-arc arrive in train area and keep look for scratch person
ix-3p-pl-arc start to ask question who be ix-2p and compare ix-3p:j to what ix-3p-pl-arc know from ix-3p-pl-arc own culture
voice can be use to determine variety information such as ix-2p work
ix-2p already have system set up what ix-3p:j mean when someone do t speak
<unk> mention concept 27 description and <unk>
ix-1p canada israeli even <unk> ix-2p identity through ix-2p voice
but interpreter be speak with very high <unk> voice
lot deaf people experience try to control ix-3p-pl-arc voice and degradation ix-3p-pl-arc voice
first topic relate to voice <unk> role voice in uighur lifelong orient culture ix-3p:j be very powerful
when someone penny ix-2p shoulder and ix-2p look and ix-3p:j be different person say <unk> thank because what ix-2p see be different than what ix-2p <unk>
many different experience with <unk> <unk> ix-3p-pl-arc
ix-3p-pl-arc will start to have understanding by learn through experience
set up two category be base on <unk> <unk> dima analysis from idea ix-3p:j present year ago
ix-3p-pl-arc be basically base on idea how human language be express
and how ix-3p-pl-arc cope and <unk> through world and <unk> ix-3p-pl-arc receive from or
however more importantly ix-3p-pl-arc also live in different <unk> world
re be two different orientation path ix-3p-pl-arc be base on what
ix-3p:j idea be basis for different culture and ix-3p-pl-arc way to interpret or give meaning to different <unk> experience
however when speech be use ix-3p-pl-arc also use gesture
idea primary system for both speak and sign language be set in ix-3p-pl-arc own way
ix-3p:j can be express through speech or through sign language
idea be basically how two precondition be different base on ix-3p-pl-arc primary message system and how people express ix-3p-pl-arc
ix-1p-pl will expand on voice and control sound in connection with experience
first one be voice and second one be control sound
second part this article be <unk> <unk> recruitment
most ix-3p:j be focus on american culture and how people contradict or give meaning to different <unk> and voice
in <unk> <unk> <unk> write about ix-3p:j as ix-3p:j quote
people from different culture do israeli just speak different language
previous issue in <unk> speculative one number one focus on variety feeling specifically <unk> orientation
re be lot key point to cover relate to multiple lifelong orientation concept
now as ix-1p-pl move on to next topic ix-1p-pl will talk specifically about needle lifelong orientation
ix-3p:j reding become as be like <unk> but ix-1p-pl collect and <unk> lifelong experience instead
but for form this ix-1p would like to focus on two thing
now ix-1p would like to focus on overseas lifelong orientation
now on relate topic how do interpreter people dima experience be include in that world
ix-3p:j reding not necessary for train consider to be acceptable to be same all over world
in field <unk> orientation ix-3p-pl-arc have ix-3p-pl-arc own way <unk> role voice
some culture have more expand range norm than or all ix-3p-pl-arc have range expectation
re be more thing on re but ix-1p be focus here on those two with respect to acceptable gain
if re driver no voice that mean re prioritise no identity
when ix-3p:j driver tear ix-3p:j can be see as lack <unk> as deception
ix-3p-pl-arc exceed normal voice range which give rise to various interpretation
people make different judgment that be in conflict give rise to <unk> politics
whoever make this kind judgment enter into <unk> politics
what happen in group people who have variety 61 <unk> orient way life be that ix-3p-pl-arc have ix-3p-pl-arc own healthy solid way life be that ix-3p-pl-arc have ix-3p-pl-arc own healthy but ix-3p-pl-arc
or perhaps re characterise something wrong with voice or person will be think to be slow 11.00 enthusiasm
this happen when people do israeli know about difference in <unk> orientation
that first <unk> have lifelong handicap <unk> orientation
ix-3p-pl-arc talk about <unk> vision and minimize <unk> <unk> sound 200statement
private people make progress with growth sign
interpreter experience have be show to be really different
ix-3p:j reding possible to enable people to learn about different <unk>
social institution influence everything from employer to education
many colleague in cultural and variety study discuss role mouth in today dima world
discussion so far n show two different <unk> 3.3 in relation to development language
in phrase character survival be now place above sound
often because judgment come from uighur dima oral perspective <unk> politics result in judgment break sound and calm <unk> this need to calm
in ix-3p-pl-arc life all deaf people really experience <unk> sound
growth sign go in one direction driver growth speaking go in anor
