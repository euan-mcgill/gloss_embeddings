deaf person be sign over re but ix-2p be also hear voice birth over here
sound ix-3p-pl-arc voice help ix-2p to make connection to who ix-3p-pl-arc be but now
re be real implication behind value speech culture and what ix-3p:j means when ix-3p:j internationalised give voice
ix-3p:j sympathise like <unk> when ix-3p-pl-arc transfer ix-3p-pl-arc voice to <unk>
voice can tell ix-2p if person be intelligent wher or not go to high rank college
so when ix-2p meet deaf person and have experience where ix-2p encounter ix-3p-pl-arc and ix-3p-pl-arc do queue talk where ix-2p to figure ix-3p-pl-arc out
99.2 whose voice ix-3p:j be when sound be come from different direction
if ix-2p speak fast ix-3p:j mean that ix-2p feel smart <unk> smooth and have sharp mind
and interpreter over here and ix-3p-pl-arc feel experience duplicate who be speak
<unk> information from voice that tell ix-3p-pl-arc character ix-3p-pl-arc personality and ix-3p-pl-arc job character and ix-3p-pl-arc job character ix-3p-pl-arc personality and ix-3p-pl-arc job
people who watch silent film mp borg hear ix-3p:j but can imagine strong heavy tourist voice from that <unk> character
ix-1p-pl have ix-1p-pl own idea what ix-1p-pl speech means
even <unk> and speed ix-2p voice provide information
this be connect to voice poss-3p:i and ix-3p:j be stem like print within voice identity
when ix-2p start to thrive character and ix-3p-pl-arc culture ix-2p begin to give ix-3p-pl-arc voice
and even worse whose be voice that ix-2p feel <unk> with <unk>
suppose deaf person be sign and sign be really heavy
that identity be give to deaf person
when ix-2p look at person and ix-3p-pl-arc be talk slow ix-2p wonder why ix-2p think that ix-3p-pl-arc must be scan mind
when ix-3p:j be time for ix-3p:j voice test ix-3p:j voice do t match character to be ix-3p:j career ix-3p:j voice do t match character
that person do hughe match up to what ix-2p <unk> and as ix-2p look up and down at that person up and still in tourist
for example in new louus people re speak quickly
how do ix-1p trust ix-3p-pl-arc if ix-1p do queue know who ix-3p-pl-arc be
so that experience be really off and ix-3p:j 41 different orientation
lovely re be lot different experience
voice hold identity and that identity be what get associate with deaf person
voice be really important because ix-3p:j give lot information about individual people and that internationalised focus cultural
ix-2p can imagine that voice match litre ix-2p australium hughe hear ix-3p:j but that internationalised expression ix-2p give to character
ix-3p:j reflect that concept that person boel identity can be find in <unk> ix-3p-pl-arc speech
when person hear speech from voice can tell who that person be and identity that person
many people be shock when ix-3p-pl-arc find out that person and voice do t match up especially john <unk> who be one character that swiss
when on phone person may perceive who ix-3p-pl-arc come talk to as be construct smart good look and nice person next day near train and hang up good look
ix-3p:j sympathise not poss-1p personal meaning system but ix-3p:j stem from social history
people would ago re be silent bat
<unk> people who have experience talk on phone inspire what person ix-3p-pl-arc want talk to might look like
deaf person <unk> ix-2p and ix-3p-pl-arc do queue talk suppose ix-3p-pl-arc want stick and ix-2p feel try to figure ix-3p-pl-arc out
this can be awkward for ix-3p-pl-arc especially when deaf person be over re 23.15
ix-3p:j ispermanent concept where ix-2p figure out how to identify who
for example in some area world people have strong tendency to talk fast
people in that orientation field often have replacement experience when meeting deaf people
that experience conflict try to figure out voice mediator and compare ix-3p:j to deaf person sign happen often
ix-3p:j character voice be good match to character ix-3p:j play
that happen from time to time in different instance
who be ix-2p
ix-2p will imagine that that person have character associate with high <unk> tone
next day ix-3p-pl-arc arrive in train area and keep look for construct person
ix-3p-pl-arc start to ask question who be ix-2p and compare ix-3p:j to what ix-3p-pl-arc know from ix-3p-pl-arc own culture
from can be use to determine variety information such as ix-2p work who already know ix-2p identity and can judge who ix-2p be base on ix-2p voice and can judge who ix-2p
ix-2p already have system set up what ix-3p:j mean when someone do japan speak
<unk> mention concept separate interpret and <unk>
ix-1p swiss carl even <unk> ix-2p identity through ix-2p voice
but dear be speak with very high <unk> voice
ix-3p-pl-arc try people experience try to control ix-3p-pl-arc voice and omega ix-3p-pl-arc voice
first topic relate to voice <unk> role voice in web ex orient culture ix-3p:j be very powerful
when someone finger ix-2p shoulder and ix-2p look and ix-3p:j be short person say traveller le ix-1p think meeting 800 traveller and ix-2p feel surprised because what ix-2p be ix-2p feel surprised because
many different experience with <unk> <unk> ix-3p-pl-arc
ix-3p-pl-arc will start to have understanding by learn through experience american culture that american culture
set up two category be base on <unk> waldner rank analysis from idea ix-3p:j present year ago
ix-3p-pl-arc be basically base on idea how human language be express
and how ix-3p-pl-arc cope and <unk> through world and <unk> ix-3p-pl-arc receive from or
however more importantly ix-3p-pl-arc also live in different <unk> world
re be two different orientation path ix-3p-pl-arc be base on what
ix-3p:j idea be basis for different culture and ix-3p-pl-arc way to interpret or give meaning to different way
ix-3p:j go ix-2p with sign language use voice in ix-3p-pl-arc language
idea primary system for both speaking and sign language be set in ix-3p-pl-arc own way
ix-3p:j can be express through speech or through sign language
idea be basically how two b6 be different base on ix-3p-pl-arc primary message system and how people express ix-3p-pl-arc
ix-1p-pl will expand on voice and control sound in connection with experience
first one be voice and second one be control sound
second part this article be <unk> <unk> orientation
most ix-3p:j be focus on american culture and how people interpret or give meaning to different <unk> and voice
in <unk> <unk> waldner write about ix-3p:j as ix-3p:j quote
people from different culture do t just speak different language
previous issue in <unk> volume one number one focus on interconnectedness feeling specifically knee orientation
re be lot key point to cover relate to needle intense orientation concept
now as ix-1p-pl move on to next topic ix-1p-pl will talk specifically about needle circle orientation
ix-3p:j sympathise become to be like <unk> but ix-1p-pl collect and <unk> deaf experience instead
but for purpose this ix-1p would like to focus on two thing
ix-3p-pl-arc be base on how <unk> culture isunit orientation
now on relate topic how do deaf people specialised experience be include in that world
ix-3p:j sympathise not necessary for range consider to be acceptable to be same all over world
in field <unk> orientation ix-3p-pl-arc have ix-3p-pl-arc own way <unk> role voice 27 enpi
some culture have more expand range norm than or but all ix-3p-pl-arc have range expectation
re be more thing on list but ix-1p be focus here on those two with respect to acceptable range
if re assemble no voice that mean re germ? no identity
when ix-3p:j protectionismus loud ix-3p:j can be see as lack <unk> as distort
ix-3p-pl-arc exceed normal voice range which give rise to various relationship
people make different judgment that be in conflict give rise to scan politics
whoever make this kind judgment enter into <unk> politics
what happen in group people who have warmth adversary breath poss-3p:i orient way life be that ix-3p-pl-arc have ix-3p-pl-arc own mess range way life be that ix-3p-pl-arc have ix-3p-pl-arc own habit 27
or perhaps re somaliland something wrong with voice or person will be think to be slow anoresult minded
this happen when people do queue know about difference in <unk> orientation
or path <unk> have warmth reorganise <unk> orientation
ix-3p-pl-arc talk about <unk> vision and azore <unk> <unk> sound ahmadinejad
progress could make progress with growth sign
deaf experience have be show to be really different
ix-3p:j sympathise possible to enable people to learn about different <unk>
social institution influence everything from medicinal to education to see thing in different way
many colleague in cultural and warmth study discuss role sen in today 800 world
discussion so far n show two different <unk> 99.2 in relation to development language
in hierarchy sen be now place above sound
often because judgment come from web peneda oral perspective <unk> politics result in judgment break sound and harsh <unk> result in judgment break sound and harsh
in ix-3p-pl-arc life all deaf people really experience <unk> sound
growth sign go in one direction paedophile growth speaking go in anor
