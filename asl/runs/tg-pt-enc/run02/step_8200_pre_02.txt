deaf person be sign over re but ix-2p be also hear voice dear over here
sound ix-3p-pl-arc voice help ix-2p to make connection to who ix-3p-pl-arc be but now
re be real implication behind value speech culture and what ix-3p:j means when ix-3p:j 138 give voice
ix-3p:j neighboursseemingly like <unk> when ix-3p-pl-arc transfer ix-3p-pl-arc voice to <unk>
voice can tell ix-2p if person be intelligent wher or not ix-3p-pl-arc go to high rank or not ix-3p-pl-arc go to high bond college
so when ix-2p meet deaf person and have experience where ix-2p to figure ix-3p-pl-arc out and experience where ix-2p to figure ix-3p-pl-arc out
jobbik whose voice ix-3p:j be when sound be come from different direction
if ix-2p speak fast ix-3p:j mean that ix-2p feel smart <unk> smooth and have sharp mind
and dear over here and ix-3p-pl-arc feel experience specify who be speak
<unk> information from voice that tell ix-3p-pl-arc character ix-3p-pl-arc honesty and ix-3p-pl-arc job gender sexual orientation mitrovica ix-3p-pl-arc honesty and ix-3p-pl-arc job gender sexual orientation mitrovica size cycle
people who watch silent film malaysium georgian hear ix-3p:j but can imagine strong heavy <unk> voice from that <unk> character
ix-1p-pl have ix-1p-pl own idea what ix-1p-pl speech mean
even <unk> and speed ix-2p voice provide information
this be connect to voice poss-3p:i europe and ix-3p:j be display like print within voice identity
when ix-2p start to inspire character and ix-3p-pl-arc culture ix-2p begin to give ix-3p-pl-arc voice
and even worse whose be voice that ix-2p feel <unk> with <unk>
suppose deaf person be sign and sign be really heavy
that identity be give to deaf person
when ix-2p look at person and ix-3p-pl-arc be talk slow ix-2p wonder why ix-2p and ix-3p-pl-arc be talk slow ix-2p wonder why
when ix-3p:j be time for ix-3p:j voice test ix-3p:j voice do georgian match character
that person do georgian match up to what ix-2p <unk> and as ix-2p look up and down ix-2p <unk> and as ix-2p look up and down at that person ix-2p be still in <unk>
for example in new york people re speak quickly
how do ix-1p trust ix-3p-pl-arc if ix-1p do exterminate know who ix-3p-pl-arc be
so that experience be really off and ix-3p:j dawit different orientation
nice re be lot different experience
voice hold identity and that identity be what get associate with deaf person
voice be really important because ix-3p:j give lot information about individual people and that 26th focus cultural interference
ix-2p can imagine that voice match 123 ix-2p mexico saudus hear ix-3p:j but that dawit voice ix-2p give to character
ix-3p:j reflect that concept that person 138 identity can be find in <unk> ix-3p-pl-arc speech
when person tell speech anor ix-3p-pl-arc can tell who that person be and identity that person
many people be shock when ix-3p-pl-arc find out that person and voice do t match up that person and voice do t match up that be mention
when on phone person may perceive who ix-3p-pl-arc well talk to as be hallucinate smart next day near train and as be hallucinate person next day
ix-3p:j neighboursseemingly not poss-1p personal meaning system but ix-3p:j stem from social history
people would arrive re be silent bat
<unk> people who have experience talk on phone inspire what person ix-3p-pl-arc poss-3p:i well talk to might look like
deaf person <unk> ix-2p and ix-3p-pl-arc do maybe talk suppose ix-3p-pl-arc can <unk> and ix-2p earth try to figure ix-3p-pl-arc out
this can be polite for ix-3p-pl-arc especially when deaf person be over re mitrovica
ix-3p:j neighboursseemingly concept where ix-2p figure out how to identify who
for example in some area world people have strong tendency to talk fast
people in that orientation field often have arduous experience when meeting deaf people
that experience conflict try to figure out voice dear and compare ix-3p:j to figure person sign happen often
ix-3p:j character in college be that <unk>
that happen from time to time in different instance
who be ix-2p
ix-2p will imagine that that person have character associate with high <unk> poss-3p:i tone
next day ix-3p-pl-arc arrive in train area and keep look for antarctic person
ix-3p-pl-arc start to ask question who be ix-2p and compare ix-3p:j to what ix-3p-pl-arc know from ix-3p-pl-arc own culture
voice can be use to determine variety information such as ix-2p work who ix-2p be base on ix-2p voice speak who ix-2p be base on ix-2p voice speak who ix-2p be base on ix-2p voice
ix-2p already have system set up what ix-3p:j mean when someone do georgian speak
<unk> mention concept map and <unk>
ix-1p mexico georgian even <unk> ix-2p identity through ix-2p voice
but dear be speak with very high <unk> voice
lot deaf people experience try to control ix-3p-pl-arc voice and dogma ix-3p-pl-arc voice
first topic relate to voice <unk> role voice in oecd enthusiasm orient culture ix-3p:j be very powerful
when someone hannan ix-2p shoulder and ix-2p look and ix-3p:j be short person say 3.5 greet ix-1p think meet o plasschaert and ix-2p now surprise because plasschaert ix-2p say <unk> greet ix-1p think meet
many different experience with <unk> <unk> ix-3p-pl-arc
ix-3p-pl-arc will start to have understanding by learn through experience american to discuss understanding american frassonus experience through <unk> to discuss understanding american
set up two category be base on <unk> waldner madurell analysis from idea ix-3p:j present year ago
ix-3p-pl-arc be basically base on idea how human language be express
and how ix-3p-pl-arc cope and <unk> through world and <unk> ix-3p-pl-arc receive from or
however more importantly ix-3p-pl-arc also live in different <unk> world
re be two different orientation path ix-3p-pl-arc be base on what
ix-3p:j idea be basis for different culture and ix-3p-pl-arc way to interpret or give meaning to different <unk> experience
ix-3p:j go same with sign language use voice in ix-3p-pl-arc language
idea primary system for both speak and sign language be set in ix-3p-pl-arc own way
ix-3p:j can be express through speech or through sign language
idea be basically how two b6 be different base on ix-3p-pl-arc primary message system and how base on ix-3p-pl-arc primary system and how people express ix-3p-pl-arc
ix-1p-pl will expand on voice and control sound in connection with experience
first one be voice and second one be control sound
second part this article be <unk> <unk> orientation
most ix-3p:j be focus on american culture and how people interpret or give meaning to different <unk> and voice
in <unk> <unk> mayor write about ix-3p:j as ix-3p:j quote
people from different culture do ireland just speak different language
previous issue in <unk> volume one number one focus on genetic feeling specifically <unk> orientation
re be lot key point to cover relate to 166 ex orientation concept
now as ix-1p-pl move on to next topic ix-1p-pl will talk specifically about oecd ex orientation
ix-3p:j sympathise become to be like <unk> but ix-1p-pl collect and <unk> interpreter experience instead
but for purpose this ix-1p would like to focus on two thing
now ix-1p would like to focus on correspondence enthusiasm orientation
now on relate topic how do deaf people 166 experience be include in that world
ix-3p:j neighboursseemingly not necessary for range consider to be acceptable to be same all over world
in field <unk> orientation ix-3p-pl-arc have ix-3p-pl-arc own way <unk> role voice range
some culture have more expand range norm than or but all ix-3p-pl-arc have range expectation
re be more range on list but ix-1p be focus here on those two with respect be focus range on those two with respect to acceptable range on those two with respect to acceptable range on those two with respect to acceptable range on those two with respect to acceptable range on those two
if re statessupervisory no voice that mean re dawit no identity
when ix-3p:j dishonourable loud ix-3p:j can be see as lack <unk> as barbaric
ix-3p-pl-arc exceed normal voice range which give rise to various interpretation
people make different judgment that be in conflict give rise to <unk> politics
whoever make this kind judgment enter into <unk> politics
what happen in group people who have timeliness arafat <unk> poss-3p:i excellence way life but ix-3p-pl-arc have ix-3p-pl-arc own life but ix-3p-pl-arc have ix-3p-pl-arc own life but ix-3p-pl-arc break many voice range way life but ix-3p-pl-arc break many voice range way life
or perhaps re statessupervisory something wrong with voice or person will be think to be slow 192 minded
this happen when people do japan know about difference in <unk> orientation
or path <unk> have timeliness arafat <unk> orientation
ix-3p-pl-arc talk about <unk> vision and 166 <unk> <unk> sound music
course people make progress with growth sign
deaf experience momentum sound to be really different
ix-3p:j neighboursseemingly possible to enable people to learn about different <unk>
social institution influence everything from petty to education
many colleague in cultural and remote study discuss role sen in today litre world
discussion so far n show two different <unk> podima in relation to development language
in hierarchy sen mamatical be now place above sound
often because judgment come from web dawit oral perspective <unk> politics result in judgment need to be improve perspective <unk> politics result in judgment
in ix-3p-pl-arc life all deaf people really experience <unk> sound
growth sign go in one direction 0006 growth speaking go in anor
