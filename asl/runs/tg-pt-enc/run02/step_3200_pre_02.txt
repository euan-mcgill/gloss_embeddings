deaf person be sign over re but ix-2p be also hear voice book over here
sound ix-3p-pl-arc voice help ix-2p to make connection to who ix-3p-pl-arc be but ix-1p-pl
re be real implication behind value speech culture and what ix-3p:j mean when ix-3p:j slovakium give voice
ix-3p:j jacek like <unk> when ix-3p-pl-arc transfer ix-3p-pl-arc voice to <unk>
voice can tell ix-2p if person be intelligent wher or not ix-3p-pl-arc go to college and wher or not ix-3p-pl-arc not ix-3p-pl-arc go to college and wher or not ix-3p-pl-arc go to college and wher or not ix-3p-pl-arc go to college and wher or not ix-3p-pl-arc go to college and wher or not ix-3p-pl-arc go to college and wher or not ix-3p-pl-arc go to college and wher or not ix-3p-pl-arc go to college and wher or not ix-3p-pl-arc go to college and wher or not ix-3p-pl-arc go to college
so when ix-2p meet lifelong person and have experience where ix-2p witness ix-3p-pl-arc and ix-3p-pl-arc do israeli talk ix-2p try to figure ix-3p-pl-arc hope
spectre whose voice ix-3p:j be when sound be come from different direction
if ix-2p speak fast ix-3p:j mean that ix-2p know smart <unk> transcend and have surprising mind
and tibetan over here and ix-3p-pl-arc feel experience separate who be speak
<unk> information from voice that tell ix-3p-pl-arc sen ix-3p-pl-arc musician and ix-3p-pl-arc job
people who watch silent scene israeli brok hear ix-3p:j but can imagine strong heavy <unk> voice from that <unk> sen
ix-1p-pl have ix-1p-pl own idea what ix-1p-pl speech mean
even <unk> and speed ix-2p voice provide information
this be link to voice poss-3p:i and ix-3p:j be discover like carpet within voice identity
when ix-2p start to accomplish sen and ix-3p-pl-arc culture ix-2p begin to give ix-3p-pl-arc voice
and even worse whose be voice that ix-2p know <unk> with <unk>
suppose deaf person be sign and sign be really heavy
that identity be give to lifelong person
when ix-2p look at person and ix-3p-pl-arc be talk slow ix-2p wonder why
when ix-3p:j be time for ix-3p:j voice test ix-3p:j voice do israeli match dream
that person do israeli match up to what ix-2p ix-2p <unk> and as ix-2p look up and down at that
for example in new <unk> people re speak quickly
how do ix-1p trust ix-3p-pl-arc if ix-1p do israeli know who ix-3p-pl-arc be
so that experience be really off and ix-3p:j esdp different orientation
nice re be lot different experience
voice hold identity and that identity be what get associate with deaf person
voice be really important because ix-3p:j give lot information about individual people and that standardise focus cultural orientation
ix-2p can imagine that voice match <unk> ix-2p israeli israeli hear ix-3p:j but that azerbaijan voice ix-2p give to sen
ix-3p:j reflect that concept that person pretence identity can be find in <unk> ix-3p-pl-arc speech
re be lot information from voice
many people be shock when ix-3p-pl-arc find out that person and voice do israeli match up especially tongue <unk> who be one sen that be mention
when on toy person may tolerate who ix-3p-pl-arc sense talk to as be downright smart and draw up <unk> look and meet smart and to be downright smart and reading up and bring up and ahead up
ix-3p:j jacek not poss-1p personal fear system but ix-3p:j visible from social history
long time ago re be silent tear
<unk> people who have experience talk on phone everyday what person ix-3p-pl-arc feel talk to might look to might look to might look to might look to might look to might look to might look to might look to might look to might look to might look to might look to might look to might look to might look to might look to might look to might look to might look to might look to might look to might look to might look to might look to might look to might look to might look to might look to might look to might look to might look to might look to might look to might look to might look to might look to might look to might look to might look to might look to might look to might look to might look to might look to might look to might look to might look to might look to might look to might look to might look to might look to might look to might look to might look to might look to might look to might look to might look to might look to might look to might look to might look to might look to might look to might look to might look to might look to might look to might look to might look to might look to might look to might look to might look to might look to might look to might look to might
deaf person <unk> ix-2p and ix-3p-pl-arc do israeli talk suppose ix-3p-pl-arc feel <unk> and ix-2p know try to figure ix-3p-pl-arc out
this can be silly for ix-3p-pl-arc especially when lifelong person be over re cfsp
ix-3p:j jacek concept where ix-2p figure out how to identify who wolskus concept
for example in some area world people have strong tendency to talk fast
people in that orientation field often have fierce experience when meeting lifelong people
that experience conflict try to figure out voice representation and compare ix-3p:j to lifelong person sign happen often
c mccreevy voice be good match to sen ix-3p:j play
that happen from time to time in different instance
who be ix-2p
ix-2p will imagine that that person have sen associate with high <unk> exit
next day ix-3p-pl-arc arrive in train area and keep look for verge person
ix-3p-pl-arc start to ask question who be ix-2p and compare ix-3p:j to what ix-3p-pl-arc know from ix-3p-pl-arc own culture
voice can be use to determine variety information such as ix-2p work
ix-2p already have system set up what ix-3p:j ix-3p:j when someone do israeli speak
<unk> mention concept lay differ and <unk>
ix-1p israeli israeli even <unk> ix-2p identity through ix-2p voice
but credentials be speak with very high <unk> voice
lot deaf people experience try to control ix-3p-pl-arc voice and nationalism ix-3p-pl-arc voice
first topic relate to voice <unk> role voice in microfinance art orient culture ix-3p:j be very powerful
when someone backing ix-2p possibly and ix-2p look and ix-3p:j be short person say <unk> thank ix-1p think meet <unk> almunium and ix-2p need surprised because what ix-2p see be different than what ix-2p <unk>
many different experience with <unk> <unk> ix-3p-pl-arc
ix-3p-pl-arc will start to have understanding by learn through experience
set up two category be base on <unk> graduate kallum analysis from idea ix-3p:j present year ago
ix-3p-pl-arc be basically base on idea how human discussion be express
and how ix-3p-pl-arc cope and <unk> through world and <unk> ix-3p-pl-arc receive from or
however more importantly ix-3p-pl-arc also live in different <unk> world
re be two different orientation path ix-3p-pl-arc be base on what
ix-3p:j idea be basis for different culture and ix-3p-pl-arc way to interpret or give grounds to different <unk> expectation
however when speech be use ix-3p-pl-arc also use gesture
idea primary system for both speak and sign discussion be set in ix-3p-pl-arc own way
ix-3p:j can be express through speech or through sign speech
idea be basically how two acceptance be different base on ix-3p-pl-arc primary message system and how people express ix-3p-pl-arc
ix-1p-pl will expand on voice and control sound in connection with experience
first one be voice and second one be control sound
second part this article be <unk> <unk> orientation
most ix-3p:j be focus on american culture and how people interpret or give grounds to different <unk> and voice
in <unk> <unk> teacher barrot about ix-3p:j as ix-3p:j quote
people from different culture do israeli just speak different language
previous issue in <unk> volume one number one focus on microfinance feeling specifically <unk> orientation
re be lot key point to cover relate to donor profile orientation concept
now as ix-1p-pl move on to next topic ix-1p-pl will talk specifically about donor insight
ecr as well
but for purpose this ix-1p would like to focus on two thing
now ix-1p would like to focus on donor gesture orientation
now on relate topic how do lifelong people subsidise experience be include in that world
ix-3p:j jacek not necessary for range consider to be acceptable to be same all over world
in field <unk> orientation ix-3p-pl-arc have ix-3p-pl-arc own way <unk> role voice range <unk>
some culture have more expand range spectrum than or but all ix-3p-pl-arc have range expectation
re be more thing on list but ix-1p be focus here on those two with respect to acceptable employ
if re endeavor no voice that mean re color no identity
when ix-3p:j endeavor loud ix-3p:j can be see as lack <unk> as transparently
ix-3p-pl-arc exceed urgency voice range which give rise to various interpretation
people make different judgment that be in conflict give rise to <unk> politics
anybody make this kind judgment enter into politics
what happen in group people who have lifelong fulfilment <unk> orient way life be that ix-3p-pl-arc have ix-3p-pl-arc own anybody but ix-3p-pl-arc break many voice range rule when ix-3p-pl-arc join different group
or perhaps re endeavor something wrong with voice or person will be think to be slow liberalise aspiration
this happen when people do israeli know about difference in <unk> orientation
that first <unk> have lifelong esdp <unk> orientation
ix-3p-pl-arc talk about <unk> vision and minimize <unk> <unk> sound standardise
deaf people make progress with growth sign
deaf experience have be show to be really different
ix-3p:j jacek possible to enable people to learn about different <unk>
social institution influence everything from fisherman to education
many colleague in cultural and lifelong study discuss role sen in today endeavor world
discussion so far n show two different <unk> profile in relation to development opinion
in nationalism sen accessibility be now place above sound
often because judgment come from cium color oral perspective <unk> politics result in judgment break sound and dubious <unk> this need to be improve
in ix-3p-pl-arc life all deaf people really experience <unk> sound
growth sign go in one direction morocco growth speaking go in anor
