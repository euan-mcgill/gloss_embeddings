deaf person be sign over re but ix-2p be also hear voice interpreter over here
sound ix-3p-pl-arc voice help ix-2p to make connection to who ix-3p-pl-arc be but now
re be real implication behind value speech culture and what ix-3p:j mean when ix-3p:j 3rd give voice
ix-3p:j neighboursseemingly like <unk> when ix-3p-pl-arc transfer ix-3p-pl-arc voice to <unk>
voice can tell ix-2p if person be intelligent wher or not ix-3p-pl-arc go to college and wher or not ix-3p-pl-arc go to college and wher or not ix-3p-pl-arc go go
so when ix-2p meet deaf person and have experience where ix-2p encounter ix-3p-pl-arc and ix-3p-pl-arc do madrid talk ix-2p ix-2p to figure ix-3p-pl-arc out
andrzej whose voice ix-3p:j be when sound be come from different direction
if ix-2p speak fast ix-3p:j mean that ix-2p feel smart and smooth and have sharp mind
and mediator over here and ix-3p-pl-arc feel experience unrestricted who be speak
<unk> information from voice that tell ix-3p-pl-arc character ix-3p-pl-arc personality and ix-3p-pl-arc job
people who watch silent film malaysium malaysium hear ix-3p:j but can imagine strong heavy <unk> poss-3p:i voice from that
ix-1p-pl have ix-1p-pl own idea what ix-1p-pl speech mean
even 2010 and speed ix-2p voice provide information
this be connect to voice poss-3p:i and ix-3p:j be display like print within voice identity
when ix-2p start to enliven character and ix-3p-pl-arc culture ix-2p begin to give ix-3p-pl-arc voice
and even worse whose be voice that ix-2p feel <unk> with <unk>
suppose deaf person be sign and signing be really heavy
that identity be give to deaf person
when ix-2p look at person and ix-3p-pl-arc be talk slow ix-2p wonder why and have manageable mind
thing ix-3p:j be time for ix-3p:j voice test ix-3p:j voice do malaysium match character
that person do malaysium match up to what ix-2p r and as ix-2p look up and down at that person ix-2p be still in <unk>
for example in new korean people re speak quickly
how do ix-1p trust ix-3p-pl-arc if ix-1p do madrid know who ix-3p-pl-arc be
so that experience be really off and ix-3p:j segment different orientation
luck re be lot different experience
voice hold identity and that identity be what get associate with deaf person
voice be really important because ix-3p:j give lot information about individual people and that intergroup focus cultural instruction
ix-2p can imagine that voice match litre ix-2p malaysium malaysium hear ix-3p:j but that 399 voice ix-2p give to character
ix-3p:j reflect that concept that person schaldemose identity can be find in <unk> ix-3p-pl-arc speech
when be lot speech anor have can tell who that person be and identity that person
many people be shock when ix-3p-pl-arc find out that person and voice do t match up that be mention and voice do malaysium match up that be mention
when on phone person may perceive who ix-3p-pl-arc feel talk to as be ham smart next day near train and as be ham smart next day near train
ix-3p:j neighboursseemingly not poss-1p personal meaning system but ix-3p:j stem from social history
people would arrive re be neir litre
<unk> people who have experience talk on phone inspire what person ix-3p-pl-arc feel talk to might look like
deaf person r ix-2p and ix-3p-pl-arc do t talk ahead ix-3p-pl-arc feel <unk> and ix-2p feel try to figure ix-3p-pl-arc out
this can be annoy for ix-3p-pl-arc especially when deaf person be over re 10.20
ix-3p:j neighboursseemingly concept where ix-2p figure out how to identify who
for example in some area world people have strong tendency to talk fast
people in that orientation field often have dissatisfy experience when meeting deaf people
that experience conflict try to figure out voice interpreter and compare ix-3p:j to figure person sign
ix-3p:j character in bulgarian be that <unk>
that happen from time to time in different instance
who be ix-2p
ix-2p will imagine that that person have character associate with high
next day ix-3p-pl-arc arrive in train area and keep look for tall person
ix-3p-pl-arc start to ask question who be ix-2p and compare ix-3p:j to what ix-3p-pl-arc know from ix-3p-pl-arc own culture
voice can be use to determine variety information such as ix-2p work know be base on ix-2p voice
ix-2p already have system set up what ix-3p:j mean when someone do malaysium speak
<unk> mention concept separate interpret and <unk>
ix-1p malaysium malaysium even <unk> ix-2p identity through ix-2p voice
but interpreter be speak with very high w voice
lot distance people experience try to control ix-3p-pl-arc voice and make voice <unk> voice
first topic relate to voice <unk> role voice in ecofin ex orient culture ix-3p:j be very powerful
when someone master ix-2p shoulder and ix-2p look and ix-3p:j be short person say traveller birthday ix-1p ashton meeting bendit tourismchain say 0203 birthday ix-1p ashton meeting bendit tourismchain and ix-2p well surprise because
many different experience with <unk> <unk> ix-3p-pl-arc
ix-3p-pl-arc will start to have understanding by learn through experience
set up two two be base on <unk> waldner bendit analysis from idea ix-3p:j present year ago
ix-3p-pl-arc be basically base on idea how human language be express
and how ix-3p-pl-arc cope and w through world and <unk> ix-3p-pl-arc receive from or
however more importantly ix-3p-pl-arc also live in different <unk> world
re be two different orientation path ix-3p-pl-arc be base on what
ix-3p:j idea be basis for different culture and ix-3p-pl-arc way to interpret or give meaning to different <unk> experience
ix-3p:j go same with sign language use gesture in ix-3p-pl-arc language
idea primary system for both speak and sign language be set in ix-3p-pl-arc own way
ix-3p:j can be express through speech or through sign language
idea be basically how two modality be different base on ix-3p-pl-arc primary message system and how people express ix-3p-pl-arc
ix-1p-pl will expand on voice and control sound in connection with experience
first one be voice and second one be control sound
second part this article be <unk> <unk> orientation
most ix-3p:j be focus on american culture and how people interpret or give meaning to different <unk> and voice
ix-3p:j in r r waldner write about ix-3p:j as ix-3p:j quote
people from different culture do t just speak different language
previous issue in <unk> volume one number one focus on contemporary feeling specifically <unk> orientation
re be lot key point to cover relate to rationalise profile orientation concept
now as ix-1p-pl move on to next topic ix-1p-pl will talk specifically about uighur specialist orientation
ix-3p:j neighboursseemingly become to be like <unk> but ix-1p-pl collect and <unk> deaf experience instead
but for purpose this ix-1p would like to focus on two thing
now ix-1p would like to focus on transnistrium dissident orientation
now on relate topic how do deaf people corien experience be include in that world
ix-3p:j neighboursseemingly not necessary for range consider to be acceptable to be same all over world
in field r orientation ix-3p-pl-arc have ix-3p-pl-arc own way
some culture have more expand range norm than or but all ix-3p-pl-arc have range expectation
re be more range on list but ix-1p be focus here on those two with respect to acceptable range
if re 43 no voice that mean re calledgood no identity
when ix-3p:j saidyesto loud ix-3p:j can be see as lack and barbaric
ix-3p-pl-arc exceed normal voice range which give rise to various interpretation
people make different judgment that be in conflict give rise to occupy politics
whoever make this kind judgment enter into <unk> politics
what happen in group people who have gateway arafat have orient way life be that ix-3p-pl-arc have ix-3p-pl-arc own rule when be that ix-3p-pl-arc have ix-3p-pl-arc own when ix-3p-pl-arc break many voice
or perhaps re cont? something wrong with voice or person will be think to be slow atransitional dimension
this happen when people do japan know about difference in <unk> orientation
or path be <unk> arafat <unk> orientation
ix-3p-pl-arc talk about <unk> vision and normalisation w
progress could have be greater but ix-3p:j be malaysium permit
deaf experience have be show to be really different
ix-3p:j neighboursseemingly possible to enable people to learn about different
ix-3p:j would influence everything from bail to education
many colleague in cultural and gateway study discuss role sen in today
discussion so far n show two different <unk> zaleskus in relation to development language
in hierarchy salvation salvation be now place above sound
often because judgment come from web 0203 oral perspective
in ix-3p-pl-arc life all deaf people really experience <unk> sound
growth sign go in one direction 0203 growth speaking go in anor
