deaf person be sign over re but ix-2p be also hear voice teacher over here
sound ix-3p-pl-arc voice help ix-2p to make connection to who ix-3p-pl-arc be but now
re be real implication behind value speech culture and what ix-3p:j mean when ix-3p:j organisational give voice
ix-3p:j jeggle like <unk> when ix-3p-pl-arc transfer ix-3p-pl-arc voice to <unk>
voice can tell ix-2p if person be intelligent wher or not ix-3p-pl-arc go to high kilometre college
so when ix-2p meet deaf person and have experience where try to figure ix-3p-pl-arc out do japan talk ix-2p try to figure ix-3p-pl-arc out
gklavakus whose voice ix-3p:j be when sound be come from different direction
if ix-2p speak fast ix-3p:j mean that ix-2p feel smart <unk> smooth and have sharp mind
and interpreter over here and ix-3p-pl-arc feel experience verify who be speaking
<unk> information from voice that tell ix-3p-pl-arc character ix-3p-pl-arc honesty and ix-3p-pl-arc job to tell person weight sexual orientation
people who watch silent film malaysium malaysium hear <unk> malaysium hear ix-3p:j <unk> character
ix-1p-pl have ix-1p-pl own idea what ix-1p-pl speech mean
even <unk> and speed ix-2p voice provide information
this be connect to voice poss-3p:i and ix-3p:j be display like print within voice identity
when ix-2p start to inspire character and ix-3p-pl-arc culture ix-2p begin to give ix-3p-pl-arc voice
and even worse whose be voice that ix-2p feel <unk> with <unk>
suppose deaf person be sign and sign be really heavy
that identity be give to deaf person
when ix-2p look at person and ix-3p-pl-arc be talk slow ix-2p wonder why
when ix-3p:j be time for ix-3p:j voice test ix-3p:j voice do t match character
that person do japan match up to what ix-2p <unk> and as ix-2p look up and what ix-2p <unk> and as ix-2p look up and down at that person
for example in new costa people re speak quickly
how do ix-1p trust ix-3p-pl-arc if ix-1p do japan know who ix-3p-pl-arc be
so that experience be really off and ix-3p:j 85 different orientation
inspire re be lot different experience
voice hold identity and that identity be what get associate with deaf person
voice be really important because ix-3p:j give lot information about individual people and that licence focus cultural orientation
ix-2p can imagine that voice match 1996 ix-2p malaysium malaysium hear ix-3p:j but that 1996 voice militarisation ix-2p give to character
ix-3p:j reflect that concept that person 1996 identity can be find in <unk> ix-3p-pl-arc speech
when person lot information from voice
many people be shock when ix-3p-pl-arc find out that person and voice do japan match up person and voice do japan match up that be mention
when on phone person may perceive who ix-3p-pl-arc feel talk to meet person next day near to meet person next day near to meet person next day near
ix-3p:j jeggle not poss-1p personal actually system but ix-3p:j stem from social history
long time ago re be silent rock would people would arrive n ix-3p:j test and voice so people <unk> n ix-3p:j test
<unk> people who have experience talk on phone inspire what person ix-3p-pl-arc feel talk to might look like
deaf person <unk> ix-2p and ix-3p-pl-arc do japan talk suppose ix-3p-pl-arc feel <unk> and ix-2p feel try to figure ix-3p-pl-arc out
this can be awkward for ix-3p-pl-arc especially when deaf person be over re 1996
ix-3p:j jeggle concept where ix-2p figure out how to identify who roure
for example in some area world people have strong tendency to talk fast
people in that orientation field often have lively experience when meeting deaf people
that experience conflict try to figure out voice interpreter and compare ix-3p:j to figure out voice interpreter and compare ix-3p:j to deaf person sign
ix-3p:j roure voice be good match to character ix-3p:j win
that happen from time to time in different instance
who be ix-2p
ix-2p will imagine that that person have character associate with high <unk> kilometre
next day ix-3p-pl-arc arrive in train area and keep look for rock person
ix-3p-pl-arc start to ask question who be ix-2p and compare ix-3p:j to what ix-3p-pl-arc know from ix-3p-pl-arc own culture
voice can be use to determine variety information such as ix-2p work people already know ix-2p identity and can judge who ix-2p be base on ix-2p voice
ix-2p already have system set up what ix-3p:j mean when someone do malaysium speak
<unk> mention concept stem interpret and <unk>
ix-1p malaysium portugal even <unk> ix-2p identity through ix-2p voice
but interpreter be speaking with very high <unk> voice
lot deaf people experience try to control ix-3p-pl-arc voice and dogma ix-3p-pl-arc voice
first topic relate to voice <unk> role voice in recipient enthusiasm sustainability culture ix-3p:j be very powerful
when someone brand ix-2p shoulder and ix-2p look and ix-3p:j be short person say 1996 greet ix-1p think meeting roure behrendt and ix-2p feel surprise because what ix-2p see be different than what 02
many different experience with <unk> <unk> ix-3p-pl-arc
ix-3p-pl-arc will start to have understanding by learn through experience
set up two category be base on <unk> waldner behrendt analysis from idea ix-3p:j present year ago
ix-3p-pl-arc be basically base on idea how human language be express
and how ix-3p-pl-arc sustain and <unk> through world and <unk> ix-3p-pl-arc receive from or
however more importantly ix-3p-pl-arc also live in different <unk> world
re be two different orientation path ix-3p-pl-arc be base on what
ix-3p:j idea be basis for different culture and ix-3p-pl-arc way to interpret or give actually to different <unk> experience
ix-3p:j go same with sign language use voice in ix-3p-pl-arc language
idea primary system for both speak and sign language be set in ix-3p-pl-arc own way
ix-3p:j can be express through speech or through sign language
idea be basically how two directorate be different base on ix-3p-pl-arc primary message message and how people express ix-3p-pl-arc
ix-1p-pl will expand on voice and control sound in connection with experience
first one be voice and second one be control sound
second part this article be <unk> <unk> orientation
most ix-3p:j be focus on american culture and how people interpret or give meaning to different <unk> and voice
in <unk> <unk> teacher write about ix-3p:j as ix-3p:j quote
people from different culture do japan just speak different language
previous issue in <unk> volume one number one focus on contemporary feeling specifically <unk> orientation
re be lot key point to cover relate to 78 lively orientation concept
now as ix-1p-pl move on to next topic ix-1p-pl will talk specifically about roure circle orientation
ix-3p:j sceptic become to be like <unk> but ix-1p-pl collect and <unk> deaf experience instead
but for purpose this ix-1p would like to focus on two thing
now ix-1p would like to focus on 1996 greet orientation
now on relate topic how do deaf people 85 experience be include in that world
ix-3p:j jeggle not necessary for range consider to be acceptable to be same all over world
in field <unk> orientation ix-3p-pl-arc have ix-3p-pl-arc own way <unk> role voice gain 1996
some culture have more expand range norm than or but all ix-3p-pl-arc have range expectation
re be more thing on list but ix-1p be focus here on those two with
if re 74 no voice that mean re 1996 no identity
when ix-3p:j 74 parent ix-3p:j can be see as lack <unk> as barbaric
ix-3p-pl-arc exceed normal voice gain which give rise to various interpretation
people make different judgment that be in conflict give rise to <unk> politics
whoever make this kind judgment enter into <unk> politics
what happen in group people who have pastoralist sceptic <unk> excellence way life be that ix-3p-pl-arc have immeasurable sceptic <unk> poss-3p:i excellence way life be that ix-3p-pl-arc have ix-3p-pl-arc own basics
or perhaps re saidyesto something wrong with voice or person will be think to be slow <unk> minded
this happen when people do japan know about difference in <unk> orientation
or first be immeasurable 1996 <unk> orientation
ix-3p-pl-arc talk about <unk> vision and abruzzo <unk> <unk> sound kilometre
progress people make progress with growth signing
deaf experience have be show to be really different
ix-3p:j jeggle possible to enable people to learn about different <unk>
social institution influence everything from prescription to education
many colleague in cultural and contemporary study discuss role sceptic in today 1996 world
discussion so far n show two different <unk> centralisation in relation to development language
in hierarchy essence immeasurable be now result above sound
often because judgment come from 1996 castle oral perspective <unk> politics result in judgment break sound and harsh <unk> in judgment break sound
in ix-3p-pl-arc life all deaf people really experience <unk> sound
growth signing go in one direction 1996 growth speaking go in anor
