deaf person be sign over re but ix-2p be also hear voice voice over here
sound ix-3p-pl-arc voice help ix-2p to make connection to who ix-3p-pl-arc be but now
re be real implication behind value speech culture and what ix-3p:j mean when ix-3p:j bric give voice
ix-3p:j saidyesterday like <unk> when ix-3p-pl-arc transfer ix-3p-pl-arc voice to <unk>
voice can tell ix-2p if person be intelligent wher or not ix-3p-pl-arc go to college and wher or or not ix-3p-pl-arc go to college and wher or not
so when ix-2p meet deaf person and have experience where ix-2p encounter ix-3p-pl-arc and ix-3p-pl-arc do watson talk ix-2p try to figure ix-3p-pl-arc brussels talk ix-2p try
athanasiu whose voice ix-3p:j be when sound be come from different direction
if ix-2p speak fast ix-3p:j mean that ix-2p want smart <unk> smooth and have sharp mind
and congo over here and ix-3p-pl-arc feel experience tracking who be speak
<unk> information from voice that tell ix-3p-pl-arc character ix-3p-pl-arc personality and ix-3p-pl-arc job weight age race gender sexual race organ sexual race
people who watch silent film scotland t hear ix-3p:j but can imagine strong heavy <unk> voice from that <unk> character
ix-1p-pl have ix-1p-pl own idea what ix-1p-pl speech means
even <unk> and speed ix-2p voice provide information
this be connect to voice poss-3p:i and ix-3p:j be display like print within voice identity
when ix-2p start to cherish character and ix-3p-pl-arc culture ix-2p begin to give ix-3p-pl-arc voice
and even worse whose be voice that ix-2p want <unk> with <unk>
suppose deaf person be sign and sign be really heavy
that identity be give to deaf person
when ix-2p look at person and ix-3p-pl-arc be talk slow ix-2p wonder why
when ix-3p:j be time for ix-3p:j voice test ix-3p:j voice do brussels match character ix-3p-pl-arc match character ix-3p-pl-arc voice do brussels match character ix-3p-pl-arc match to be and ix-3p:j career
that person do brussels match up to what ix-2p <unk> and as ix-2p look up and down at that person ix-2p be still in that person ix-2p be down at that
for example in new york people re speak quickly
how do ix-1p trust ix-3p-pl-arc if ix-1p do so know who ix-3p-pl-arc be
so that experience be really off and ix-3p:j mochovce different orientation
fantastic re be lot different experience
voice hold identity and that identity be what get associate with deaf person
voice be really important because ix-3p:j give lot information about individual people and that privatise focus cultural orientation
ix-2p can imagine that voice match kilometre ix-2p australium watson hear ix-3p:j but that saidyesto voice ix-2p give to character
ix-3p:j reflect that concept that person iseurope identity can be find in <unk> ix-3p-pl-arc speech
when person hear speech anor voice can tell who that person be and identity that person
many people be shock when ix-3p-pl-arc find out that person and voice do somehow match up especially maltese <unk> that be one character that match up that
when on phone person may perceive who ix-3p-pl-arc want talk to as be knock smart good sit near train and hang up good look and nice talk to as be nice smart good look and nice
ix-3p:j saidyesterday not poss-1p personal meaning system but ix-3p:j stem from social history
people would arrive ix-3p:j be to be in silent outrage but n ix-3p:j change and voice be add so ix-3p:j change and voice be add so people voice test
<unk> people who have experience talk on phone healthier what healthier what person ix-3p-pl-arc want talk like
deaf person <unk> ix-2p and ix-3p-pl-arc do borg talk suppose ix-3p-pl-arc want <unk> and ix-2p want try to figure suppose ix-3p-pl-arc want <unk> and ix-2p want try
this can be awkward for ix-3p-pl-arc especially when deaf person be over re
ix-3p:j saidyesterday concept where ix-2p figure out how to identify who
for example in some area world people have strong tendency to talk fast
people in that orientation field often have emphatic experience when meeting deaf people
that experience conflict try to figure out voice journey and compare ix-3p:j to interpreter person sign happen often
ix-3p:j character voice cypriot be that <unk>
that happen from time to time in different instance
who be ix-2p
ix-2p will imagine that that person have character associate with high <unk> tone
next day ix-3p-pl-arc arrive in train area and keep look for verge person
ix-3p-pl-arc start to ask question who be ix-2p and compare ix-3p:j to what ix-3p-pl-arc know from ix-3p-pl-arc own culture
from can be use to determine variety information such as ix-2p work from ix-2p voice be base on ix-2p voice
ix-2p already have system set up what ix-3p:j mean when someone do brussels speak
<unk> mention concept separate interpret and <unk>
ix-1p australium simpson even <unk> ix-2p identity through ix-2p voice
but contact be speak with very high <unk> voice
lot deaf people experience try to control ix-3p-pl-arc voice and conception ix-3p-pl-arc voice
first topic relate to voice <unk> role voice in web ex orient culture ix-3p:j be very powerful
when someone penny ix-2p shoulder and ix-2p look and ix-3p:j be short person say kibakus <unk> ix-1p think meeting asiatic liechtenstein and ix-2p life ix-2p think meeting asiatic liechtenstein and ix-2p life ix-2p think meeting
many different experience with <unk> <unk> ix-3p-pl-arc
ix-1p-pl often start deaf people 200let experience through <unk> to discuss understanding american culture
set up two category be base on <unk> waldner corticeira analysis from idea ix-3p:j present year ago
ix-3p-pl-arc be basically base on idea how human language be express
and how ix-3p-pl-arc cope and <unk> through world and <unk> ix-3p-pl-arc receive from or
however more importantly ix-3p-pl-arc also live in different <unk> world
re be two different orientation path ix-3p-pl-arc be base on what
ix-3p:j idea be basis for different culture and ix-3p-pl-arc way to interpret or give meaning to different <unk> experience
ix-3p:j go speech be use ix-3p-pl-arc also use gesture in ix-3p-pl-arc language
idea primary system for both speak and sign language be set in ix-3p-pl-arc own way
ix-3p:j can be express through speech or through sign language
idea be basically how two modality be different base on ix-3p-pl-arc primary message system and how people express ix-3p-pl-arc
ix-1p-pl will expand on voice and control sound in connection with experience
first one be voice and second one be control sound
second part this article be <unk> <unk> orientation
most ix-3p:j be focus on american culture and how people interpret or give meaning to different <unk> and voice
in <unk> <unk> waldner write about ix-3p:j as ix-3p:j quote
people from different culture do japanese just speak different language
previous issue in <unk> volume one number one focus on 12.30 feeling specifically <unk> orientation
re be lot key point to cover relate to developer ex orientation concept
now as ix-1p-pl move on to next topic ix-1p-pl will talk specifically about periodic kilometre orientation
ix-3p:j aone become to be like <unk> but ix-1p-pl collect and <unk> deaf experience instead
but for purpose this ix-1p would like to focus on two thing
ix-3p-pl-arc be base on how <unk> culture 84 orientation
now on relate topic how do deaf people 86 experience be include in that world
ix-3p:j saidyesterday not necessary for range consider to be acceptable to be same all over world
in field <unk> orientation ix-3p-pl-arc have ix-3p-pl-arc own way <unk> role voice range
some culture have more expand range norm than or but all ix-3p-pl-arc have range expectation
re be more thing on list but ix-1p be focus here on those two with respect to acceptable range
if re sayyou no voice that mean re 56 no identity
when ix-3p:j 114 loud ix-3p:j can be see as lack <unk> as distort
ix-3p-pl-arc extend normal voice loss which give rise to various interpretation
people make different judgment that be in conflict give rise to <unk> politics
whoever make this kind judgment enter into <unk> politics
what happen in group people who have relaxation 56 <unk> orient way life be that ix-3p-pl-arc have ix-3p-pl-arc own group poss-3p:i orient way life be that ix-3p-pl-arc have ix-3p-pl-arc own group
or perhaps re 74 something wrong with voice or person will be think to be slow anoresult minded
this happen when people do brussels know about difference in <unk> orientation
or first <unk> have modulation thatprofit <unk> orientation
ix-3p-pl-arc talk about <unk> vision and azore <unk> <unk> sound corticeira
progress could make progress with growth sign progress could have be greater but ix-3p:j be malaysium permit
interpreter experience dominant sound around ix-3p-pl-arc
ix-3p:j saidyesterday possible to enable people to learn about different
ix-3p:j institution influence everything from prescription to education to see thing in different way
many colleague in cultural and quantitative study discuss role sen in today 64 world
discussion so far n show two different <unk> 56 in relation to development language
in hierarchy sen interactive be now place above sound
often because judgment come from web dawit oral perspective <unk> politics result in judgment break sound and harsh politics result in judgment break sound and harsh
in ix-3p-pl-arc life all deaf people really experience <unk> sound
growth sign go in one direction corticeira growth speak go in anor
