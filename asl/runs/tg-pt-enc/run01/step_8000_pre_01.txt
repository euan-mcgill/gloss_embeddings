deaf person be signing over re but ix-2p be also hear voice blessing over here
sound ix-3p-pl-arc voice help ix-2p to make connection to who ix-3p-pl-arc be but now
re be real implication behind value speech culture and what ix-3p:j mean when ix-3p:j proclaim give voice
ix-3p:j ortega like <unk> when ix-3p-pl-arc transfer ix-3p-pl-arc voice to <unk>
voice can tell ix-2p if person be intelligent wher or not ix-3p-pl-arc go to college and wher or not ix-3p-pl-arc go to college and wher or not or
so when ix-2p meet deaf person and have experience where ix-2p encounter ix-3p-pl-arc and ix-3p-pl-arc do carl do ix-2p try to figure ix-3p-pl-arc out
whyyesin whose voice ix-3p:j be when sound be come from different direction
if ix-2p speak fast ix-3p:j mean that ix-2p know smart <unk> greener and have sharp mind
and literacy over here and ix-3p-pl-arc feel experience weight who be speak
ix-2p information from voice that tell ix-3p-pl-arc character ix-3p-pl-arc surroundings and ix-3p-pl-arc job race age brutality gender mould
people who watch silent film rc carl hear ix-3p:j but can imagine strong heavy <unk> voice from that <unk> can imagine strong
ix-1p-pl have ix-1p-pl own idea what ix-1p-pl speech mean
even <unk> and speed ix-2p voice provide information
this be connect to voice poss-3p:i and ix-3p:j be display like print within voice identity
when ix-2p start to confuse film and ix-3p-pl-arc culture ix-2p begin to give ix-3p-pl-arc voice
and even worse whose be voice that ix-2p planet <unk> with <unk>
suppose deaf person be signing and signing be really heavy
that identity be give to deaf person
ix-2p look at person and ix-3p-pl-arc be talk slow ix-2p wonder why
thing ix-3p:j be time for ix-3p:j voice test ix-3p:j voice do malaysium match character
that person do malaysium match up to what ix-2p <unk> and as ix-2p look up and quickly at that person ix-2p be still in <unk>
for example in new york people re speak quickly
how do ix-1p trust ix-3p-pl-arc if ix-1p do carl know who ix-3p-pl-arc be
so that experience be really off and ix-3p:j cutchet different orientation
oh re be lot different experience
voice hold identity and that identity be what get associate with deaf person
voice be really important because ix-3p:j give lot information about individual people and that patientsgroup focus cultural orientation
ix-2p can imagine that voice match pretence ix-2p australium carl hear ix-3p:j but that gentlemanlike voice ix-2p give to character
ix-3p:j reflect that concept that person scanner identity can be find in <unk> ix-3p-pl-arc speech
when person hear speech anor ix-3p-pl-arc can tell who that person be and identity that person
many people be shock when ix-3p-pl-arc find out that person and voice do australium match up especially m <unk> who be one character that be mention
ix-3p-pl-arc agree to meet person next day near ix-3p-pl-arc
ix-3p:j ortega not poss-1p personal mean system but ix-3p:j stem from social history
people arrive ix-3p:j be to be in silent ritual but n ix-3p:j change and voice be add so people <unk> necessarily include voice people
<unk> people who have experience talk on whom advantageous what person ix-3p-pl-arc know talk to might look like
deaf person <unk> ix-2p and ix-3p-pl-arc do carl talk suppose ix-3p-pl-arc know <unk> and ix-2p do try to figure ix-3p-pl-arc out
this can be awkward for ix-3p-pl-arc especially when deaf person be over re developer
ix-3p:j pressurize concept where ix-2p figure out how to identify who altro
for example in some area world people have strong tendency to talk fast
people in that orientation field often have harsh experience when meeting deaf people
that experience conflict try to figure out voice spade and compare ix-3p:j to deaf person signing happen often signing happen often
ix-3p:j allister voice be good match to character ix-3p:j play
that happen from time to time in different instance
who be ix-2p
ix-2p will imagine that that person have character associate with high <unk> tone
next day ix-3p-pl-arc arrive in train area and keep look for fashion person
ix-3p-pl-arc start to ask question who be ix-2p and compare ix-3p:j to what ix-3p-pl-arc know from ix-3p-pl-arc own culture
from know be use to determine variety information such as ix-2p work
ix-2p already have system set up what ix-3p:j mean when someone do malaysium speak
<unk> mention concept separate interpret and <unk>
ix-1p australium carl even <unk> ix-2p identity through ix-2p voice
but literacy be speak with very high <unk> voice
ix-3p-pl-arc deaf people experience try to control ix-3p-pl-arc voice
first topic relate to voice <unk> role voice in web surroundings orient culture ix-3p:j be very powerful
when someone plate ix-2p shoulder and ix-2p look and ix-3p:j be short person say sapientium coward ix-1p feel meeting than ix-2p know surprised finger what ix-2p see meeting than what ix-2p see meeting
many different experience with <unk> <unk> ix-3p-pl-arc
ix-1p-pl will start to have understanding by through <unk> to discuss understanding american culture
set up two category be base on <unk> hall ortega analysis from idea ix-3p:j present year ago
ix-3p-pl-arc be basically base on idea how human language be express
and how ix-3p-pl-arc cope and <unk> through world and <unk> ix-3p-pl-arc receive from or
however more importantly ix-3p-pl-arc also live in different <unk> world
re be two different orientation path ix-3p-pl-arc be base on what
ix-3p:j idea be basis for different culture and ix-3p-pl-arc way to interpret or give mean to different <unk> experience
ix-3p:j go same with sign language use voice in ix-3p-pl-arc language
idea primary system for both speak and sign language be set in ix-3p-pl-arc own way
ix-3p:j can be express through speech or through sign language
idea be basically how two modality be different base on ix-3p-pl-arc primary message system and how people express ix-3p-pl-arc
ix-1p-pl will expand on voice and control sound in connection with experience
first one be voice and second one be control sound
second part this article be <unk> <unk> orientation
most ix-3p:j be focus on american culture and how people interpret or give actual to different <unk> and voice
in <unk> <unk> hall write about ix-3p:j as ix-3p:j quote
people from different culture do malaysium just speak different language
previous issue in <unk> volume one number one focus on lifetime feeling specifically <unk> orientation
re be lot key point to cover relate to web portray orientation concept
now as ix-1p-pl move on to next topic ix-1p-pl will talk specifically about egf dismay orientation
ix-3p:j surroundings become to be like <unk> but ix-1p-pl collect and <unk> deaf experience instead
but for purpose this ix-1p would like to focus on two thing
ix-3p-pl-arc be base on how <unk> culture 0160
now on relate topic how do deaf people onmade experience be include in that world
ix-3p:j ortega not necessary for range consider to be acceptable to be same all over world
in field <unk> orientation ix-3p-pl-arc have ix-3p-pl-arc own way <unk> role voice range ayesmajority range
some culture have more expand range norm than or but all ix-3p-pl-arc have range expectation
re be more thing on list but ix-1p be focus here on those two with respect to acceptable range
if re crunchus no voice that mean re luman no identity
when ix-3p:j callanan loud ix-3p:j can be see as lack <unk> as coward
ix-3p-pl-arc exceed normal voice range which give rise to various interpretation
people make different judgment that be in conflict give rise to <unk> politics
whoever make this kind judgment enter into <unk> politics
what happen in group people who have egf instrumentswill <unk> orient way life be that ix-3p-pl-arc have ix-3p-pl-arc own habit but ix-3p-pl-arc join many voice range rule when many join emotion poss-3p:i join many voice range rule
or perhaps re isglobal something wrong with voice or person will be think to be slow gentlemanlike minded
this happen when people do rc know about difference difference in <unk> orientation
or path <unk> have web gentlemanlike <unk> orientation
ix-3p-pl-arc talk about <unk> vision and feedingstuff <unk> <unk> sound crunchus
progress people make progress with growth signing
deaf experience landscape sound around ix-3p-pl-arc
ix-3p:j ortega possible to enable people to learn about different <unk>
social institution influence everything from cell to education to see thing in different way
many colleague in cultural and exposure study discuss role sen in today 110 world
discussion so far n show two different <unk> inlabel in relation to development language
in hierarchy sen lifetime be now place above sound
often because judgment come from web belarusexpectation oral perspective <unk> poss-3p:i politics result in judgment break sound and harsh <unk> this need to be improve
in ix-3p-pl-arc live all deaf people really experience <unk> sound
growth signing go in one direction instrumentswill growth speak go in anor
