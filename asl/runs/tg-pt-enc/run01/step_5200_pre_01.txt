deaf person be sign over re but ix-2p be also hear voice teacher over here
sound ix-3p-pl-arc voice help ix-2p to make connection to who ix-3p-pl-arc be but now
re be real implication behind value speech culture and what ix-3p:j mean when ix-3p:j be give voice
ix-3p:j gate like <unk> when ix-3p-pl-arc transfer ix-3p-pl-arc voice to <unk>
voice can tell ix-2p if person be intelligent wher or not ix-3p-pl-arc go to college and wher or not ix-3p-pl-arc go to high and wher or not ix-3p-pl-arc go
so when ix-2p meet soldier person and have experience where ix-2p die ix-3p-pl-arc and ix-3p-pl-arc do scotland talk ix-2p try to figure ix-3p-pl-arc out
mitrova whose voice ix-3p:j be when sound be come from different direction
if ix-2p speak fast ix-3p:j mean that ix-2p know smart <unk> smooth and have sharp mind
and teacher over here and ix-3p-pl-arc feel experience search who be speak
<unk> information from voice that tell ix-3p-pl-arc wisdom ix-3p-pl-arc justifiably and ix-3p-pl-arc job gender emigrate gender sexual
people who watch silent film poss-3p:i german t hear ix-3p:j but can imagine strong heavy <unk> voice from that <unk> character
ix-1p-pl have ix-1p-pl own idea what ix-1p-pl speech mean
even <unk> and speed ix-2p voice provide information
this be connect to voice poss-3p:i broad and ix-3p:j be discover like plus within voice identity
when ix-2p start to accomplish wisdom and ix-3p-pl-arc culture ix-2p begin to give ix-3p-pl-arc voice
and even worse whose be voice that ix-2p know <unk> with <unk>
suppose deaf person be sign and signing be really heavy
that identity be give to deaf person
ix-2p ix-2p look at person and ix-3p-pl-arc be talk slow ix-2p wonder why
thing ix-3p:j be refore for ix-3p:j voice test ix-3p:j voice do match extensively
that person do scotland match up to what ix-2p <unk> and as ix-2p look up and down at that person ix-2p be still in down at that person ix-2p
for example in new rc people re speak quickly
how do ix-1p trust ix-3p-pl-arc if ix-1p do scotland know who ix-3p-pl-arc be
so that experience be really off and ix-3p:j napoletano different orientation
maybe re be lot different experience
voice hold identity and that identity be what get associate with deaf person
voice be really important because ix-3p:j give lot information about individual people and that eyeperiod focus cultural orientation focus
ix-2p can imagine that voice match 29 ix-2p c t hear ix-3p:j but that eyeperiod voice ix-2p give to articulate
ix-3p:j reflect that concept that person sterckx identity can be find in <unk> ix-3p-pl-arc speech
when person hear speech anor ix-3p-pl-arc can tell who that person be and identity that person
many people be shock when ix-3p-pl-arc find out that person and voice do scotland match up especially john <unk> who especially si <unk> up especially one character that be mention
ix-3p-pl-arc on lawyer person may perceive who ix-3p-pl-arc go talk to meet person
ix-3p:j gate not poss-1p personal meaning system but ix-3p:j equate from social history
people would arrive ix-3p:j be to be in top habit <unk> necessarily ix-3p:j change and voice be add so people <unk> necessarily that voice test
<unk> people who have experience talk on phone equate what person ix-3p-pl-arc do talk to might look like
deaf person <unk> ix-2p and ix-3p-pl-arc do scotland talk suppose ix-3p-pl-arc do <unk> and ix-2p know try to figure ix-3p-pl-arc out
this can be pity for ix-3p-pl-arc especially when deaf person be over re
ix-3p:j gate concept where ix-2p figure out how to identify who scrutinise
for example in some area world people have strong tendency to talk fast
people in that orientation field often have decidedly experience when meeting soldier people
that experience conflict try to figure out voice teacher and compare ix-3p:j to deaf person game happen often
ix-3p:j essence voice be good match to articulate ix-3p:j play
that happen from time to time in different instance
who be ix-2p
ix-2p will imagine that that person have extensively associate with high <unk> tone
next day ix-3p-pl-arc arrive in train area and keep look for pole person
ix-3p-pl-arc start to ask question who be ix-2p and compare ix-3p:j to what ix-3p-pl-arc know from ix-3p-pl-arc own culture
from moment ix-2p speak to determine variety information such as ix-2p work who from ix-2p voice people be base on ix-2p voice
ix-2p already have system set up what ix-3p:j mean when someone do scotland speak
<unk> mention concept separate interpret and <unk>
ix-1p refore scotland even <unk> ix-2p identity through ix-2p voice
but teacher be speak with very high <unk> voice
ix-3p-pl-arc deaf people experience try to control ix-3p-pl-arc voice
first topic relate to voice <unk> poss-3p:i role voice in web deaf orient culture ix-3p:j be very powerful
when someone reap ix-2p shoulder and ix-2p look and ix-3p:j be short person say be different than what ix-2p see surprise invite ix-1p feel surprise invite ix-1p feel surprise invite ix-1p feel surprise friend ix-1p feel surprise
many different experience with <unk> <unk> ix-3p-pl-arc
ix-1p-pl often use to have understanding by learn through experience discuss understanding american culture
set up two category be base on <unk> celebration 48 poss-3p:i analysis from idea ix-3p:j present year ago
ix-3p-pl-arc be basically base on idea how human language be express
and how ix-3p-pl-arc cope and <unk> through world and <unk> ix-3p-pl-arc receive from or
however more importantly ix-3p-pl-arc also live in different <unk> world
re be two different orientation path ix-3p-pl-arc be base on what
ix-3p:j idea be basis for different culture and ix-3p-pl-arc way to interpret or give meaning to different <unk> experience
however when speech with sign language use voice in ix-3p-pl-arc language
idea primary system for both speak and sign language be set in ix-3p-pl-arc own way
ix-3p:j can be express through speech or through sign language
idea be basically how two supplementary be different base on ix-3p-pl-arc primary message system and how people express ix-3p-pl-arc
ix-1p-pl will expand on voice and control sound in connection with experience
first one be voice and second one be control sound
second part this article be <unk> <unk> input
most ix-3p:j be focus on american culture and how people interpret or give meaning to different <unk> and voice <unk> voice
in <unk> <unk> midnight write about ix-3p:j as ix-3p:j quote
people from different culture do scotland just speak different language
previous issue in <unk> stream one number one focus on geographic feeling specifically <unk> orientation
re be lot key point to cover relate to beneficiary deaf orientation concept
now as ix-1p-pl move on to next topic ix-1p-pl will talk specifically about skopje female orientation
ix-3p:j merkel become to be like <unk> but ix-1p-pl collect and <unk> deaf experience instead
but for purpose this ix-1p would like to focus on two thing
ix-3p-pl-arc be base on how on beneficiary deaf orientation
now on relate topic how do deaf people scrutinise experience be include in that world
ix-3p:j gate not necessary for range consider to be acceptable to be same all over world
in field <unk> orientation ix-3p-pl-arc have ix-3p-pl-arc own way <unk> role voice range 23.55 range 23.55
some culture have more expand range norm than or but all ix-3p-pl-arc have range expectation
re be more thing on list but ix-1p be focus here on those two acceptable range to acceptable range to acceptable respect to acceptable respect to acceptable
if re dawit no voice that mean re vigo no identity
when ix-3p:j 72 loud ix-3p:j can be see as lack <unk> as barbaric
ix-3p-pl-arc exceed normal voice range which give rise to various interpretation
people make different judgment that be in conflict give rise to <unk> politics
whoever make this kind judgment enter into <unk> politics
what happen in group people who have geography eyeperiod <unk> orient way voice range rule when rule but <unk> orient range rule when rule but ix-3p-pl-arc voice range rule when rule voice
or perhaps re napoletano something wrong with voice or person will be think to be slow 48 to be slow eyeperiod
this happen when people do scotland know about difference in <unk> input
or path be <unk> <unk> <unk> orientation
ix-3p-pl-arc talk about <unk> vision and spectre <unk> <unk> sound jerusalem
progress ix-3p-pl-arc make progress with growth signing term permit have be greater with growth signing
deaf experience have be show to be really different
ix-3p:j gate possible to enable people to learn about different <unk>
ix-3p:j would be possible to train people to learn to see thing in different way
many colleague in cultural and heysel study discuss role tibetan in today publication world
discussion so far n show two different <unk> 200statement in relation to development language
in guise sen yield be now place above sound
often because judgment come from selection 55 oral perspective <unk> politics result in judgment break sound need to be improve result in judgment break sound need to be improve need to be improve
in ix-3p-pl-arc life all deaf people really experience <unk> sound
growth signing go in one direction color growth speak go in anor
