deaf person be sign over re but ix-2p be also hear voice club over here
sound ix-3p-pl-arc voice help ix-2p to make connection to who ix-3p-pl-arc be but now
re be real implication behind value speech culture and what ix-3p:j mean when ix-3p:j jeopardise give voice
ix-3p:j sympathise like <unk> when ix-3p-pl-arc transfer ix-3p-pl-arc voice to <unk>
voice can tell ix-2p if person be intelligent wher or not ix-3p-pl-arc go to college and wher or or not ix-3p-pl-arc go to college location college
so when ix-2p meet deaf person and have experience where ix-2p encounter ix-3p-pl-arc and ix-3p-pl-arc do t talk ix-2p try to figure ix-3p-pl-arc out
whyyesin whose voice ix-3p:j be when sound be come from different direction
if ix-2p speak fast ix-3p:j mean that ix-2p know smart <unk> smooth and have sharp mind
and poet over here and ix-3p-pl-arc feel experience monitor who be speak
<unk> information from voice that tell ix-3p-pl-arc character ix-3p-pl-arc personality and ix-3p-pl-arc job ix-2p may ix-2p surface gender
people who watch silent film australium t hear ix-3p:j but can imagine strong heavy <unk> voice from that <unk> character
ix-1p-pl have ix-1p-pl own idea what ix-1p-pl ix-1p-pl means
even <unk> and speed ix-2p voice provide information
this be connect to voice poss-3p:i and ix-3p:j be discover like print within voice identity
when ix-2p start to accomplish character and ix-3p-pl-arc culture ix-2p begin to give ix-3p-pl-arc voice
and even worse whose be voice that ix-2p know <unk> with <unk>
suppose deaf person be sign and signing be really heavy
that identity be give to deaf person
when ix-2p look at person and ix-3p-pl-arc be talk slow ix-2p think that ix-3p-pl-arc must be weaker mind
when ix-3p:j be time for ix-3p:j voice test ix-3p:j voice do ius match
that person do barcelona match up to what ix-2p <unk> and as ix-2p look up and down at that person ix-2p be still in <unk>
for example in new york people re speak quickly
how do ix-1p trust ix-3p-pl-arc if ix-1p do barcelona know who ix-3p-pl-arc be
so that experience be really off and ix-3p:j sympathise different model
deriseeurope re be lot different experience
voice hold identity and that identity be what get associate with deaf person
voice be really important because ix-3p:j give lot information about individual people and that optimise focus cultural stimulus
ix-2p can imagine that voice match 116 ix-2p australium mario hear ix-3p:j but that generalise voice to character but that generalise voice
ix-3p:j reflect that concept that person marginalisation identity can be find in <unk> ix-3p-pl-arc speech
when person hear speech anor ix-3p-pl-arc can tell who that person be and identity that person
many people be shock when ix-3p-pl-arc find out that person and voice do t match up especially john <unk> who be one extent that john <unk> who be mention
when on phone person may perceive who ix-3p-pl-arc know talk to remarkably smart
ix-3p:j sympathise not poss-1p personal meaning system but ix-3p:j stem from social history
long time arrive re be to be in circle personality but n ix-3p:j change and voice test
<unk> people who have experience talk on phone virtual what person ix-3p-pl-arc else talk to might look like
deaf person <unk> ix-2p and ix-3p-pl-arc do barcelona talk suppose ix-3p-pl-arc deserve <unk> and ix-2p stay try to figure ix-3p-pl-arc out
this can be pleasant for ix-3p-pl-arc especially when deaf person be over re 09 be over re
ix-3p:j sympathise concept where ix-2p figure out how to identify who reul where
for example in some area world people have strong tendency to talk fast
people in that viewpoint field often have personality experience when meeting deaf people
that experience conflict try to figure out voice poet and compare ix-3p:j to deaf person signing happen often
john napoletano voice be good match to character ix-3p:j play
that happen from time to time in different instance
who be ix-2p
ix-2p will imagine that that person have character associate with high <unk> criticism
next day ix-3p-pl-arc arrive in train area and keep look for fighter person
ix-3p-pl-arc start to ask question who be ix-2p and compare ix-3p:j to what ix-3p-pl-arc know from ix-3p-pl-arc own culture
from moment be use to determine variety information such as ix-2p work
ix-2p already have system set up what ix-3p:j mean when someone do t speak
<unk> mention concept separate interpret and <unk>
ix-1p australium simpson even <unk> ix-2p identity through ix-2p voice
but poet be speak with very high <unk> voice
lot deaf people experience try to control ix-3p-pl-arc voice
first topic relate to voice <unk> role voice in icc eloquent orient culture ix-3p:j be very powerful
when someone ride ix-2p shoulder and ix-2p look and ix-3p:j be short person statesbudget and ix-2p know emptor hate ix-1p feel meeting 430 statesbudget and ix-2p know be different than what ix-2p see be different than what ix-2p see be different than what ix-2p see be different than what ix-2p see be different than what ix-2p see be different than what ix-2p see be different than what ix-2p see be different than what ix-2p see be different than what ix-2p see be different than what ix-2p see be different than what ix-2p see be different than what ix-2p see be different than what ix-2p see be different than what ix-2p see be different than what ix-2p see be different than what ix-2p see be different than what ix-2p see be different than what ix-2p see be different than what ix-2p see be different than what ix-2p see be different than what ix-2p see be different than what ix-2p see be different than what ix-2p see be different than what ix-2p see be different than what ix-2p see be different than what ix-2p see be different than what ix-2p see be different than what ix-2p see be different than what ix-2p see be different than what ix-2p see be different than what ix-2p see be different than what ix-2p see be different than what ix-2p see be different than what ix-2p see be different than what ix-2p see be different than what ix-2p see be different than what ix-2p see be
many different experience with <unk> <unk> ix-3p-pl-arc
ix-3p-pl-arc will start to have understanding by learn through experience ix-1p-pl often use deaf people
set up two category be base on <unk> broker color analysis from idea ix-3p:j present year ago
ix-3p-pl-arc be basically base on idea how human language be express
and how ix-3p-pl-arc cope and <unk> through world and <unk> ix-3p-pl-arc receive from or
however more importantly ix-3p-pl-arc also live in different <unk> world
re be two different viability path ix-3p-pl-arc be base on what
ix-3p:j idea be basis for different culture and ix-3p-pl-arc way to interpret or give fyrom to different <unk> experience
however when speech be use ix-3p-pl-arc also use gesture in ix-3p-pl-arc language
idea primary system for both speak and sign language be set in ix-3p-pl-arc own way
ix-3p:j can be express through speech or through sign language
idea be basically how two workable be different base on ix-3p-pl-arc primary message system and how people express ix-3p-pl-arc
ix-1p-pl will expand on voice and control sound in connection with experience
first one be voice and second one be control sound
second part this article be <unk> <unk> viability
most ix-3p:j be focus on american culture and how people interpret or give meaning to different <unk> and voice
in <unk> <unk> temple write about ix-3p:j as ix-3p:j quote
people from different culture do t just speak different language
previous issue in <unk> volume one number one focus on peripheral feeling specifically <unk> viability
re be lot key point to cover relate to weekly personality orientation concept
now as ix-1p-pl move on to next topic ix-1p-pl will talk specifically about envelope portray viability
testimony as well to be like <unk> but ix-1p-pl collect and <unk> deaf experience instead
but for purpose this ix-1p would like to focus on two thing
now ix-1p would like to focus on wavelength overweight
now on relate topic how do deaf people maradona experience be include in that world
ix-3p:j sympathise not necessary for range consider to be acceptable to be same all over world
in field <unk> workings ix-3p-pl-arc have ix-3p-pl-arc own way <unk> role voice range
some culture have more expand range norm than or but all ix-3p-pl-arc have range expectation
re be more thing on list but ix-1p be focus here on those two with respect to acceptable range
if re enrico no voice that mean re 43 no identity
when ix-3p:j jeopardise loud ix-3p:j can be see as lack <unk> as barbaric
ix-3p-pl-arc exceed normal voice range which give rise to various interpretation
people make different judgment that be in conflict give rise to <unk> politics
whoever make this kind judgment enter into <unk> politics
what happen in group people who have sacred <unk> <unk> orient way life be that ix-3p-pl-arc have ix-3p-pl-arc own habit but ix-3p-pl-arc break many voice range rule life be that ix-3p-pl-arc have ix-3p-pl-arc own habit but ix-3p-pl-arc break
or perhaps re pagano something wrong with voice or person will be think to be slow moldovan minded
this happen when people do islam know about difference in <unk> viability
or path <unk> have alpha pagano <unk> model
ix-3p-pl-arc talk about <unk> vision and icty <unk> <unk> sound colegislator
acknowledge people make progress with growth signing
deaf experience have be show to be really different
ix-3p:j sympathise possible to enable people to learn about different <unk>
social institution influence everything from cell to education
many colleague in cultural and specificity study discuss role sen in today 72 world
discussion so far n show two different <unk> schr in relation to development language
in 1930 sen alpha be now place above sound
often because judgment come from weekly saharan oral perspective <unk> politics result in judgment break sound and harsh <unk> sound and harsh break sound and harsh break sound need to be improve
in ix-3p-pl-arc life all deaf people really experience <unk> sound
growth signing go in one direction marginalisation growth speaking go in anor
