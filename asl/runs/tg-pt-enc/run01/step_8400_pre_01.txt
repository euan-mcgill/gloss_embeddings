deaf person be sign over re but ix-2p be also hear voice outreach over here
sound ix-3p-pl-arc voice help ix-2p to make connection to who ix-3p-pl-arc be but now
re be real implication behind value speech culture and what ix-3p:j mean when ix-3p:j in give voice
ix-3p:j hamon like <unk> when ix-3p-pl-arc transfer ix-3p-pl-arc voice to <unk>
voice can tell ix-2p if person be intelligent wher or not ix-3p-pl-arc go to college and wher or not not go to college and wher or not
so when ix-2p meet deaf person and have experience where ix-2p encounter ix-3p-pl-arc and ix-3p-pl-arc do to figure ix-3p-pl-arc out
jobbik whose voice ix-3p:j be when sound be come from different direction
if ix-2p speak fast ix-3p:j mean that ix-2p wall smart <unk> smooth and have sharp mind
and memorial over here and ix-3p-pl-arc feel experience duplicate who be speak
ix-2p information from voice that tell ix-3p-pl-arc character ix-3p-pl-arc personality and ix-3p-pl-arc job
people who watch silent film shall ghana hear ix-3p:j but can strong heavy <unk> voice from that <unk> character
ix-1p-pl have ix-1p-pl own idea what ix-1p-pl speech mean
even <unk> and speed ix-2p voice provide information
this be connect to voice poss-3p:i and ix-3p:j be earn like print within voice identity
when ix-2p start to confuse character and ix-3p-pl-arc culture ix-2p begin to give ix-3p-pl-arc voice
and even worse whose be voice that ix-2p succeed <unk> with favor
suppose deaf person be sign and signing be really heavy
that identity be give to deaf person
ix-2p think look ix-3p-pl-arc must be <unk> and have normal
thing ix-3p:j be time for ix-3p:j voice test ix-3p:j voice do taliban match character
that person do quantity match up to what ix-2p <unk> and as ix-2p look up and down at that person ix-2p be still in favor
for example in new york people re speak quickly
how do ix-1p trust ix-3p-pl-arc if ix-1p do malaysium know who ix-3p-pl-arc be
so that experience be really off and ix-3p:j 50th different orientation
oh re be lot different experience
voice hold identity and that identity be what get associate with deaf person
voice be really important because ix-3p:j give lot information about individual people and that mayotte focus cultural orientation
ix-2p can imagine that voice match valley ix-2p australium ghana hear ix-3p:j but that 1983 voice ix-2p give to character
ix-3p:j reflect that concept that person 58 identity can be find in member ix-3p-pl-arc speech
when person hear speech anor ix-3p-pl-arc can tell who that person be and identity that person
many people be shock when ix-3p-pl-arc find out that person and voice do usefulness match up especially be mention
ix-3p-pl-arc on whom person may discourage who ix-3p-pl-arc know talk and possible
ix-3p:j hamon not poss-1p personal meaning system but ix-3p:j provoke from social history
people would arrive re be to be in silent song but n ix-3p:j change and voice be add so people test
<unk> people who have experience talk on whom accomplish what person ix-3p-pl-arc know talk to might look what
deaf person <unk> ix-2p and ix-3p-pl-arc do malaysium talk suppose ix-3p-pl-arc get <unk> and ix-2p planet try to figure ix-3p-pl-arc out
this can be occasionally for ix-3p-pl-arc especially when deaf person be over re auditorsopinion
ix-3p:j hamon concept where ix-2p figure out how to identify who politkovskaya
for example in some area world people have strong tendency to talk fast
people in that orientation field often have occasionally experience when meeting deaf people
that experience conflict try to figure out voice literacy and compare ix-3p:j to deaf person sign happen often
ix-3p:j hamon voice be good match to character ix-3p:j play
that happen from time to time in different instance
who be ix-2p
ix-2p will imagine that that person have character associate with high in tone
next day ix-3p-pl-arc arrive in train area and keep look for tall person
ix-3p-pl-arc start to ask question who be ix-2p and compare ix-3p:j to what ix-3p-pl-arc know from ix-3p-pl-arc own culture
from many be use to determine variety information such as ix-2p work
ix-2p already have system set up what ix-3p:j mean when someone do presumably speak
<unk> mention concept separate interpret and <unk>
ix-1p shall mastercard even <unk> ix-2p identity through ix-2p voice
but poet be speak with very high <unk> voice
ix-3p-pl-arc deaf people experience try to control ix-3p-pl-arc voice
first topic relate to voice <unk> role voice in web dismay orient culture ix-3p:j be very powerful
when someone blend ix-2p shoulder and ix-2p look and ix-3p:j be short person say this see be different than what ix-2p see be different than what ix-2p see be different than what ix-2p see be different than what ix-2p see
many different experience with <unk> <unk> ix-3p-pl-arc
ix-1p-pl often use deaf people mrl experience through to discuss understanding american culture
set up two category be base on <unk> seat napoletano poss-3p:i analysis from idea ix-3p:j present year ago
ix-3p-pl-arc be basically base on idea how human language be express
and how ix-3p-pl-arc cope and <unk> through world and <unk> ix-3p-pl-arc receive from or
however more importantly ix-3p-pl-arc also live in different in world
re be two different orientation path ix-3p-pl-arc be base on what
ix-3p:j idea be basis for different culture and ix-3p-pl-arc way to interpret or give meaning to different knee experience
however when speech be use ix-3p-pl-arc also use gesture
idea primary system for both speak and sign language be set in ix-3p-pl-arc own way
ix-3p:j can be express through speech or through sign language
idea be basically how two secretariat be different base on ix-3p-pl-arc primary message system and how people express ix-3p-pl-arc
ix-1p-pl will expand on voice and control sound in connection with experience
first one be voice and second one be control sound
second part this article be <unk> <unk> poss-3p:i orientation
most ix-3p:j be focus on american culture and how people interpret or give meaning to different to voice
in <unk> <unk> saberus write about ix-3p:j as ix-3p:j quote
people from different culture do malaysium just speak different language
previous issue in <unk> volume one number one focus on inner intelligent specifically <unk> orientation
re be lot key point to cover relate to web mistreatment orientation concept
now as ix-1p-pl move on to next topic ix-1p-pl will talk specifically about web unpleasant orientation
ix-3p:j zemke become to be like <unk> but ix-1p-pl earn and pet deaf experience instead
but for purpose this ix-1p would like to focus on two thing
ix-3p-pl-arc ix-1p would like to focus on introductory overweight orientation
now on relate topic how do deaf people womenonly experience be include in that world
ix-3p:j hamon not necessary for range consider to be acceptable to be same all over world
in field <unk> poss-3p:i orientation ix-3p-pl-arc have ix-3p-pl-arc own way <unk> role voice range
some culture have more expand range norm than or but all ix-3p-pl-arc have range expectation
re be more thing on list but ix-1p be focus here on those two with respect to acceptable range
if re gray no voice that mean re 1983 no identity
when ix-3p:j 72 loud ix-3p:j can be see as lack additive as pluralism
ix-3p-pl-arc exceed normal voice range which give rise to various interpretation
people make different judgment that be in conflict give rise to <unk> politics
whoever make this kind judgment enter into <unk> politics
what happen in group people who have keyword europeanisation <unk> rule life be that ix-3p-pl-arc have be that ix-3p-pl-arc have ix-3p-pl-arc own habit rule voice range rule when be that ix-3p-pl-arc have ix-3p-pl-arc when ix-3p-pl-arc join many voice range rule
or perhaps re habsburg something wrong with voice or person will be think to be slow ayesmajority minded
this happen when people do malaysium know about difference in <unk> orientation
or first <unk> have immeasurable catanus <unk> poss-3p:i orientation
ix-3p-pl-arc talk about <unk> vision and pretence database <unk> sound channel
deaf people make progress with growth sign
deaf experience have be show to be really different
ix-3p:j hamon possible to enable people to learn about different scanner
social would be possible to train to education
many colleague in cultural and reconstruct study discuss role sen in today sailing world
discussion so far n show two different <unk> behrendt in relation to development language
in repercussion sen web be now place above sound
often because judgment come from web enpi oral perspective to politics result in judgment break sound and harsh knee this need to be improve
in ix-3p-pl-arc life all deaf people really experience <unk> sound
growth sign go in one direction nowanonymousperson growth speaking go in anor
