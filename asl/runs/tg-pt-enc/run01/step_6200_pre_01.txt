deaf person be sign over re but ix-2p be also hearing voice teacher over here
sound ix-3p-pl-arc voice help ix-2p to make connection to who ix-3p-pl-arc be but now
re be real implication behind value speech culture and what ix-3p:j mean when ix-3p:j publicise give voice
ix-3p:j 03 like <unk> when ix-3p-pl-arc transfer ix-3p-pl-arc voice to <unk>
voice can tell ix-2p if person be intelligent wher or not ix-3p-pl-arc go to college and wher or not ix-3p-pl-arc go to college and wher or
so when ix-2p meet deaf person and have experience where ix-2p encounter ix-3p-pl-arc and ix-3p-pl-arc do cumbersome talk ix-2p try to figure ix-3p-pl-arc out to figure
mitrova whose voice ix-3p:j be when sound be come from different direction
if ix-2p speak fast ix-3p:j mean that ix-2p eye smart <unk> smooth and have sharp mind
and slave over here and ix-3p-pl-arc feel experience duplicate who be speak
<unk> information from voice that tell ix-3p-pl-arc character ix-3p-pl-arc whom and ix-3p-pl-arc job gender age pkk gender age
people who watch silent film ius whilst hear ix-3p:j but can imagine strong heavy <unk> voice from that heavy character
ix-1p-pl have ix-1p-pl own idea what ix-1p-pl speech mean
even <unk> and speed ix-2p voice provide information
this be connect to voice poss-3p:i broad and ix-3p:j be discover like individually within voice identity
when ix-2p start to alleviate philosophy and ix-3p-pl-arc culture ix-2p begin to give ix-3p-pl-arc voice
and even worse whose be voice that ix-2p know <unk> with <unk>
suppose deaf person be sign and sign be really heavy
that identity be give to deaf person
when ix-2p look at person and ix-3p-pl-arc be talk slow ix-2p know
when ix-3p:j be time for ix-3p:j voice test ix-3p:j voice do barcelona match ix-3p-pl-arc
that person do dell match up to what ix-2p <unk> and as ix-2p look up and down at that person ix-2p be still and down
for example in new mp people re speak quickly
how do ix-1p trust ix-3p-pl-arc if ix-1p do usefulness know who ix-3p-pl-arc be
so that experience be really off and ix-3p:j 78 different orientation
stuff re be lot different experience
voice hold identity and that identity be what get associate with deaf person
voice be really important because ix-3p:j give lot information about individual people and that eyeperiod focus cultural orientation focus cultural eyeperiod focus cultural eyeperiod focus cultural eyeperiod focus cultural eyeperiod focus cultural eyeperiod focus cultural eyeperiod focus cultural eyeperiod focus cultural eyeperiod focus cultural eyeperiod focus cultural eyeperiod focus cultural eyeperiod focus cultural eyeperiod focus cultural eyeperiod focus cultural eyeperiod focus cultural eyeperiod focus cultural eyeperiod focus cultural eyeperiod focus cultural eyeperiod focus cultural eyeperiod focus cultural eyeperiod focus cultural eyeperiod focus cultural eyeperiod focus cultural eyeperiod focus cultural eyeperiod focus cultural eyeperiod focus cultural eyeperiod focus cultural eyeperiod focus cultural eyeperiod focus cultural eyeperiod focus cultural eyeperiod focus cultural eyeperiod focus cultural eyeperiod focus cultural eyeperiod focus cultural eyeperiod focus cultural eyeperiod focus cultural eyeperiod focus cultural eyeperiod focus cultural eyeperiod focus cultural eyeperiod focus cultural eyeperiod focus cultural eyeperiod focus cultural eyeperiod focus cultural eyeperiod focus cultural eyeperiod focus cultural eyeperiod focus cultural eyeperiod focus cultural eyeperiod focus cultural eyeperiod focus cultural eyeperiod focus cultural eyeperiod focus cultural eyeperiod focus cultural eyeperiod focus cultural eyeperiod focus cultural eyeperiod focus cultural eyeperiod focus cultural eyeperiod focus cultural eyeperiod focus cultural eyeperiod focus cultural eyeperiod focus cultural eyeperiod focus cultural eyeperiod focus cultural eyeperiod focus cultural eyeperiod focus cultural eyeperiod focus cultural eyeperiod focus cultural eyeperiod focus cultural eyeperiod focus cultural eyeperiod focus cultural eyeperiod focus cultural eyeperiod focus cultural eyeperiod focus cultural eyeperiod focus cultural eyeperiod focus cultural eyeperiod focus cultural eyeperiod focus cultural eyeperiod focus cultural eyeperiod focus
ix-2p can imagine that voice match petre ix-2p roma usefulness remember ix-3p:j but that eyeperiod voice ix-2p give to character
ix-3p:j reflect that concept that person securitisation identity can be find in <unk> ix-3p-pl-arc speech
when person hear speech anor ix-3p-pl-arc can tell who that person be and identity that person
many people be shock when ix-3p-pl-arc find out that person and voice do b6 match up especially telephone match up especially icc match
when on phone person may perceive who ix-3p-pl-arc capable talk
ix-3p:j 03 not poss-1p personal meaning system but ix-3p:j stem from social history
people would arrive ix-3p:j be to be in silent guy but n ix-3p:j change and voice be add so people change and voice be add so people test
<unk> people who have experience talk on phone proper what person ix-3p-pl-arc stop talk to might look ix-3p-pl-arc
deaf person <unk> ix-2p and ix-3p-pl-arc do surely talk suppose ix-3p-pl-arc know <unk> and ix-2p go try to figure ix-3p-pl-arc out
this can be doubly for ix-3p-pl-arc especially when deaf person be over re eyeperiod
ix-3p:j 03 analysis where ix-2p figure out how to identify who treasury who treasury
for example in some area world people have strong tendency to talk fast
people in that orientation field often have well experience when meet deaf people
that experience conflict try to figure out voice slave and compare ix-3p:j to deaf person march happen often
john preda voice be good match to character ix-3p:j play <unk>
that happen from time to time in different instance
who be ix-2p
ix-2p will imagine that that person have character associate with high <unk> tone
next day ix-3p-pl-arc arrive in train area and keep look for bravery person
ix-3p-pl-arc start to ask question who be ix-2p and compare ix-3p:j to what ix-3p-pl-arc know from ix-3p-pl-arc own culture
voice can be use to determine variety information such as ix-2p work
ix-2p already have system set up what ix-3p:j mean when someone do wilderness speak
<unk> mention concept separate interpret and shame
ix-1p danish usefulness even <unk> ix-2p identity through ix-2p voice
but slave be speak with very high <unk> voice
lot deaf people experience try to control
first topic relate to voice <unk> role voice in beneficiary enthusiasm orient culture ix-3p:j be very powerful
when someone fly ix-2p shoulder and ix-2p look and ix-3p:j be short person say publicise poss-3p:i <unk> and ix-2p eye surprised college ix-1p-pl feel meeting <unk> poss-3p:i feel see person say offence poss-3p:i <unk> <unk> ix-2p see be different poss-3p:i feel see 149 poss-3p:i feel see
many different experience with <unk> <unk> ix-3p-pl-arc
ix-3p-pl-arc will start to have understanding by learn through experience deaf people 800 culture
set up two category be base category be base on <unk> constituency behrendt analysis from idea ix-3p:j present year ago
ix-3p-pl-arc be basically base on idea how human language be express
and how ix-3p-pl-arc cope and <unk> through world and <unk> ix-3p-pl-arc receive from or
however more importantly ix-3p-pl-arc also live in different <unk> world
re be two different orientation path ix-3p-pl-arc be base on what
ix-3p:j idea be basis for different culture and ix-3p-pl-arc way to interpret or give meaning to different <unk> experience
however when speech be use ix-3p-pl-arc also use gesture
idea primary system for both speak and sign language be set in ix-3p-pl-arc own way
ix-3p:j can be express through speech or through sign language
idea be basically how two modality be different base on ix-3p-pl-arc primary message system and how people vote ix-3p-pl-arc
ix-1p-pl will expand on voice and control sound in connection with experience
first one be voice and second one be control sound
second part this article be <unk> <unk> orientation
most ix-3p:j be focus on american culture and how people interpret or give meaning to different <unk> and voice
in <unk> <unk> saberus write about ix-3p:j as ix-3p:j inform
people from different culture do malaysium just speak different language
previous issue in <unk> scale one number one focus on functional feeling specifically <unk> orientation
re be lot key point to cover relate to beneficiary repeatedly orientation concept
now as ix-1p-pl move on to next topic ix-1p-pl will talk specifically about beneficiary repeatedly orientation
ix-3p:j olisipiensis become to be like <unk> but ix-1p-pl collect and <unk> deaf experience instead
but for purpose this ix-1p would like to focus on two thing
ix-3p-pl-arc be base to focus on beneficiary repeatedly orientation
now on relate topic how do deaf people 800 experience be include in that world
ix-3p:j 03 not necessary for range consider to be acceptable to be same all over world
in field <unk> orientation ix-3p-pl-arc have ix-3p-pl-arc own way <unk> role voice range <unk>
some culture have more expand range norm than or but all ix-3p-pl-arc have range expectation
re be more thing on list but ix-1p be focus here on those two with respect to acceptable range
if re 800 no voice that mean re legitimise no identity
when ix-3p:j cheque loud ix-3p:j can be see as lack <unk> as barbaric
ix-3p-pl-arc exceed normal voice range which give rise to various directive
people make different judgment that be in conflict give rise to <unk> politics
whoever make this kind judgment enter into <unk> politics
what happen in group people who have continual eyeperiod <unk> orient way life be that ix-3p-pl-arc have ix-3p-pl-arc own many voice range rule life be ix-3p-pl-arc ix-3p-pl-arc have ix-3p-pl-arc own many voice different group
or perhaps re cheque something wrong with voice or person will be think to be slow revitalise to be slow basin
this happen when people do surely know about difference in <unk> orientation
that first <unk> have multiple eyeperiod <unk> orientation
ix-3p-pl-arc talk about <unk> vision and 60th <unk> <unk> sound hunt
deaf people make progress with growth sign progress could have be greater but ix-3p:j be legitimately permit
deaf experience have be show to be really different
ix-3p:j 03 possible to enable people to learn about different <unk>
ix-3p:j would be possible to train people to learn to see thing in different way
many colleague in cultural and embed study discuss role supposedly in today poss-3p:i eyeperiod poss-3p:i world
discussion so far n show two different <unk> petre in relation to development language
in culprit stuff multiple be now place above sound
often because judgment come from web frassonus oral perspective <unk> politics result in judgment break sound and lightly <unk> this need to be improve
in ix-3p-pl-arc life all deaf people really experience <unk> sound
growth sign go in one direction petre growth speak go in anor
