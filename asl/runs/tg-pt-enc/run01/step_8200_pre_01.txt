deaf person be sign over re but ix-2p be also hear voice microphone over here
sound ix-3p-pl-arc voice help ix-2p to make connection to who ix-3p-pl-arc be but now
re be real implication behind value speech culture and what ix-3p:j mean when ix-3p:j ber?s give voice
ix-3p:j pressurize like <unk> when ix-3p-pl-arc transfer ix-3p-pl-arc voice to <unk>
voice can tell ix-2p if person be intelligent wher or not ix-3p-pl-arc go to college and wher or not ix-3p-pl-arc go to college and wher or not ix-3p-pl-arc go
so when ix-2p meet deaf person and have experience where ix-2p encounter ix-3p-pl-arc and ix-3p-pl-arc do gsp talk ix-2p try to figure ix-3p-pl-arc out
jobbik whose voice ix-3p:j be when sound be come from different direction
if ix-2p speak fast ix-3p:j mean that ix-2p know smart <unk> smooth and have sharp mind
and memorial over here and ix-3p-pl-arc feel experience tag who be speak
ix-2p information from voice that tell ix-3p-pl-arc character ix-3p-pl-arc personality and ix-3p-pl-arc job age race gender sexual orientation debtorsasset
people who watch silent film token t hear ix-3p:j but can imagine strong heavy <unk> voice from that <unk> character
ix-1p-pl have ix-1p-pl own idea what ix-1p-pl speech mean
even <unk> and speed ix-2p voice provide information
this be connect to voice poss-3p:i and ix-3p:j be display like individually within voice identity
when ix-2p start to shape character and ix-3p-pl-arc culture ix-2p begin to give ix-3p-pl-arc voice
and even worse whose be voice that ix-2p know <unk> with <unk>
suppose deaf person be sign and signing be really heavy
that identity be give to deaf person
ix-2p think look ix-3p-pl-arc must be overlook and have tenth mind ix-2p wonder why
thing ix-3p:j be time for ix-3p:j voice test ix-3p:j voice do malaysium match character
that person do legitimately match up to what ix-2p <unk> and as ix-2p look up and down at that person ix-2p be still in <unk>
for example in new york people re speak quickly
how do ix-1p trust ix-3p-pl-arc if ix-1p do malaysium know who ix-3p-pl-arc be
so that experience be really off and ix-3p:j centralise different orientation
maybe re be lot different experience
voice hold identity and that identity be what get associate with deaf person
voice be really important because ix-3p:j give lot information about individual people and that mepsaccountability focus cultural orientation
ix-2p can imagine that voice match 98 ix-2p japanese t hear ix-3p:j but that 1980 voice match refuelling give to character
ix-3p:j reflect that concept that person summarise identity can be find in <unk> ix-3p-pl-arc speech
when person hear speech anor ix-3p-pl-arc can tell who that person be and identity that person
many people be shock when ix-3p-pl-arc find out that person and voice do usefulness match up especially m <unk> who be one character that be mention
ix-3p-pl-arc agree to meet person next perceive who ix-3p-pl-arc know talk
ix-3p:j pressurize not poss-1p personal mean system but ix-3p:j stem from social history
people arrive ix-3p:j be to be in ear song but n ix-3p:j change and voice be add so people <unk> necessarily include voice test
<unk> people who have experience talk on whom mirror what person ix-3p-pl-arc know talk to might look like
deaf person <unk> ix-2p and ix-3p-pl-arc do camara talk suppose ix-3p-pl-arc know <unk> and ix-2p planet try to figure ix-3p-pl-arc out
this can be awkward for ix-3p-pl-arc especially when deaf person be over re horizon
ix-3p:j pressurize concept where ix-2p figure out how to identify who statesgovernment
for example in some area world people have strong tendency to talk fast
people in that orientation field often have pity experience when meeting deaf people
that experience conflict try to figure out voice microphone and compare ix-3p:j to deaf person sign happen often
ix-3p:j frassonus in ear be that <unk>
that happen from time to time in different instance
who be ix-2p
ix-2p will imagine that that person have character associate with high <unk> tone
next day ix-3p-pl-arc arrive in train area and keep look for alive person
ix-3p-pl-arc start to ask question who be ix-2p and compare ix-3p:j to what ix-3p-pl-arc know from ix-3p-pl-arc own culture
from can be use to determine variety information such as ix-2p work from can judge who ix-2p be base on ix-2p voice
ix-2p already have system set up what ix-3p:j mean when someone do hence speak
<unk> mention concept separate interpret and <unk>
ix-1p danish barcelona even <unk> ix-2p identity through ix-2p voice
but microphone be speak with very high <unk> voice
ix-3p-pl-arc deaf people experience try to control ix-3p-pl-arc voice
first topic relate to voice <unk> role voice in mumbaus praise orient culture ix-3p:j be very powerful
when someone blow ix-2p shoulder and ix-2p look and ix-3p:j be short person say zelaya hate i ix-2p see meeting than what ix-2p <unk> meeting than what ix-2p <unk> meeting than what ix-2p see meeting than what
many different experience with <unk> <unk> ix-3p-pl-arc
ix-1p-pl often use deaf people tolegislative experience through <unk> experience ix-1p-pl understanding american culture
set up two category be base on <unk> hall keyser poss-3p:i analysis from idea ix-3p:j present year ago
ix-3p-pl-arc be basically base on idea how human language be express
and how ix-3p-pl-arc cope and <unk> through world and <unk> ix-3p-pl-arc receive from or
however more importantly ix-3p-pl-arc also live in different <unk> world
re be two different orientation path ix-3p-pl-arc be base on what
ix-3p:j idea be basis for different culture and ix-3p-pl-arc way to interpret or give mean to different <unk> experience
ix-3p:j go same be use ix-3p-pl-arc also use voice in ix-3p-pl-arc language
idea primary system for both speak and sign language be set in ix-3p-pl-arc own way
ix-3p:j can be express through speech or through sign language
idea be basically how two modality be different base on ix-3p-pl-arc activity message system and how people express ix-3p-pl-arc
ix-1p-pl will expand on voice and control sound in connection with experience
first one be voice and second one be control sound
second part this article be alert <unk> orientation
most ix-3p:j be focus on american culture and how people interpret or give mean to different <unk> and voice
in <unk> <unk> hall write about ix-3p:j as ix-3p:j quote
people from different culture do malaysium just speak different language
previous issue in <unk> volume one number one focus on peripheral feeling specifically <unk> orientation
re be lot key point to cover relate to mumbaus revenge orientation concept
now as ix-1p-pl move on to next topic ix-1p-pl will talk specifically about individually dismay orientation
ix-3p:j pressurize become to be like <unk> but ix-1p-pl collect and <unk> deaf experience instead
but for purpose this ix-1p would like to focus on two thing
ix-3p-pl-arc be base on how <unk> culture
now on relate topic how do deaf people nistelrooij experience be include in that world
ix-3p:j pressurize not necessary for range consider to be acceptable to be same all over world
in field <unk> orientation ix-3p-pl-arc have ix-3p-pl-arc own way <unk> role voice range ayesmajority
some culture have more expand range norm than or but all ix-3p-pl-arc have range expectation
re be more thing on list but ix-1p be focus here on those two with respect to acceptable range
if re centralise no voice that mean re luman no identity
when ix-3p:j centralise loud ix-3p:j can be see as lack <unk> as barbaric
ix-3p-pl-arc exceed normal voice range which give rise to various interpretation
people make different judgment that be in conflict give rise to <unk> politics
whoever make this kind judgment enter into <unk> politics
what happen in group people who have mixture cca <unk> orient way life be that ix-3p-pl-arc have ix-3p-pl-arc own habit but ix-3p-pl-arc break many voice ix-3p-pl-arc join different voice ix-3p-pl-arc join different voice
or perhaps re ippc something wrong with voice or person will be think to be slow words minded
this happen when people do malaysium know about difference in <unk> orientation
or path <unk> have mixture smss <unk> orientation
ix-3p-pl-arc talk about <unk> vision and 45th <unk> <unk> sound hugo
deaf people have be greater but growth sign
deaf experience have be show to be really different
ix-3p:j pressurize possible to enable people to learn about different <unk>
social would be possible to train people to learn to education thing in different way
many colleague in cultural and exposure study discuss role sen in today rigor world
discussion so far n show two different <unk> diamandouro in relation to development language
in repercussion sen mixture be now place above sound
often because judgment come from centralised centralise oral perspective <unk> politics result in judgment break sound and harsh <unk> this need to be improve
in ix-3p-pl-arc life all deaf people really experience <unk> sound
growth sign go in one direction instrumentswill growth speaking go in anor
