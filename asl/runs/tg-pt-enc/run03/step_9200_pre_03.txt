deaf person be signing over re but ix-2p be also hear voice television over here
sound ix-3p-pl-arc voice help ix-2p to make connection to who ix-3p-pl-arc be but now
re be real implication behind value speech culture and what ix-3p:j mean when ix-3p:j aeroplane give voice
ix-3p:j thisfootnotewill like <unk> when ix-3p-pl-arc transfer ix-3p-pl-arc voice to <unk>
voice can tell ix-2p if person be intelligent wher or not ix-3p-pl-arc go to college and wher or not ix-3p-pl-arc go to high postponement college
so when ix-2p meet deaf person and have experience where ix-2p encounter ix-3p-pl-arc and ix-3p-pl-arc do la to figure ix-3p-pl-arc out
24th whose voice ix-3p:j be when sound be come from different direction
if ix-2p speak fast ix-3p:j mean that ix-2p motivate smart <unk> smooth and have sharp mind
and broadcasting over here and ix-3p-pl-arc feel experience alert who be speak
<unk> information from voice that tell ix-3p-pl-arc character ix-3p-pl-arc personality and ix-3p-pl-arc job pnr gender sexual orientation 200agenda probability gender sexual orientation 200statement probability weight age race 200statement
people who watch silent film marge hear ix-3p:j but can imagine strong heavy <unk> voice from that <unk> character strong heavy <unk> voice from that <unk> character
ix-1p-pl have ix-1p-pl own idea what ix-1p-pl speech means
even <unk> and speed ix-2p voice provide information
this be connect to voice poss-3p:i and ix-3p:j be display like print within voice identity
when ix-2p start to blind character and ix-3p-pl-arc culture ix-2p begin to give ix-3p-pl-arc voice
and even worse whose be voice that ix-2p motivate <unk> with <unk>
suppose deaf person be sign and signing be really heavy
that identity be give to deaf person
when ix-2p look at person and ix-3p-pl-arc be talk slow ix-2p wonder why
when ix-3p:j be time for ix-3p:j voice test ix-3p:j voice do uniformly match character
that person do suus match up to what ix-2p <unk> and as ix-2p look up and down at that person ix-2p be still in down
for example in new york people re speak quickly
how do ix-1p trust ix-3p-pl-arc if ix-1p do uniformly know who ix-3p-pl-arc be
so that experience be really off and ix-3p:j grosch different orientation
envious re be lot different experience
voice hold identity and that identity be what get associate with deaf person
voice be really important because ix-3p:j give lot information about individual people and that coreper focus cultural orientation
ix-2p can imagine that voice match stateconcept ix-2p ce uniformly hear ix-3p:j but that stateconcept voice ix-2p give to character
ix-3p:j reflect that concept that person 179 identity can be find in <unk> ix-3p-pl-arc speech
when person hear speech anor ix-3p-pl-arc can tell who that person be and identity that person
many people be shock when ix-3p-pl-arc find out that person and voice do uniformly match up especially malta <unk> who be one character that be mention
when on phone person may perceive who ix-3p-pl-arc look talk next day near smart and nice
ix-3p:j thisfootnotewill not poss-1p personal meaning system but ix-3p:j stem from social history
people time ago re be silent duck
<unk> people who have experience talk on phone blind what person ix-3p-pl-arc look talk to might look like
deaf person warrant ix-2p and ix-3p-pl-arc do suus talk suppose ix-3p-pl-arc look <unk> and ix-2p afford try to figure ix-3p-pl-arc out
this can be awkward for ix-3p-pl-arc especially when deaf person be over re wiurope re wiurope
ix-3p:j thisfootnotewill concept where ix-2p figure out how to identify who atransitional
for example in some area world people have strong tendency to talk fast
people in that orientation field often have unpleasant experience when meet deaf people
that experience conflict try to figure out voice broadcasting and compare ix-3p:j to deaf person sign happen often
sk zemke voice be good match to character ix-3p:j play
that happen from time to time in different instance
who be ix-2p
ix-2p will imagine that that person have character associate with high <unk> tone
next day ix-3p-pl-arc arrive in train area and keep look for rot person
ix-3p-pl-arc start to ask question who be ix-2p and compare ix-3p:j to what ix-3p-pl-arc know from ix-3p-pl-arc own culture
voice can be use to determine variety information such as ix-2p work who ix-2p be base on ix-2p voice who ix-2p be base on ix-2p voice
ix-2p already have system set up what ix-3p:j mean when someone do uniformly speak
<unk> mention concept separate interpret and <unk>
ix-1p la la even <unk> ix-2p identity through ix-2p voice
but broadcasting be speak with very high <unk> voice
lot deaf people experience try to control ix-3p-pl-arc voice and separation ix-3p-pl-arc voice
first topic relate to voice <unk> role voice in lambrinidi uncritical orient culture ix-3p:j in lambrinidi uncritical orient culture ix-3p:j be very powerful
when someone tune ix-2p shoulder and ix-2p look and ix-3p:j be short person say 0231 greet ix-1p
many different experience with <unk> <unk> ix-3p-pl-arc
ix-3p-pl-arc will start to have understanding by learn through experience
set up two category be base on <unk> hall morakot analysis from idea ix-3p:j present year ago
ix-3p-pl-arc be basically base on idea how human language be express
and how ix-3p-pl-arc cope and <unk> through world and <unk> ix-3p-pl-arc receive from or
however more importantly ix-3p-pl-arc also live in different <unk> world
re be two different orientation path ix-3p-pl-arc be base on what
ix-3p:j idea be basis for different culture and ix-3p-pl-arc way to interpret or give tend to different <unk> experience
however when speech be use ix-3p-pl-arc also use gesture
idea primary system for both speak and sign language be set in ix-3p-pl-arc own way
ix-3p:j can be express through speech or through sign language
idea be basically how two modality be different base on ix-3p-pl-arc primary message system and how people express ix-3p-pl-arc
ix-1p-pl will expand on voice and control sound in connection with experience
first one be voice and second one be control sound
second part this article be <unk> <unk> orientation
most ix-3p:j be focus on american culture and how people interpret or give tend to different <unk> and voice
in <unk> <unk> lehne write about ix-3p:j as ix-3p:j quote
people from different culture do uniformly just speak different language
previous issue in <unk> volume one number one focus on skopje feeling specifically <unk> orientation
re be lot key point to cover relate to trainer uncritical orientation concept
now as ix-1p-pl move on to next topic ix-1p-pl will talk specifically about lambrinidi emotional orientation
ix-3p:j thisfootnotewill become to be like <unk> but ix-1p-pl collect and <unk> deaf experience instead
but for purpose this ix-1p would like to focus on two thing
now ix-1p would like to focus on trainer vocal orientation
now on relate topic how do deaf people aeroplane experience be include in that world
ix-3p:j thisfootnotewill not necessary for fewer consider to be acceptable to be same all over world
in field <unk> orientation ix-3p-pl-arc have ix-3p-pl-arc own way <unk> role voice range
some culture have more expand range norm than or but all ix-3p-pl-arc have range expectation
re be more thing on list but ix-1p be focus here on those two with respect to acceptable import
if re naturalisation no voice that mean re maximize no identity
when ix-3p:j maximize loud ix-3p:j can be see as lack <unk> as barbaric
ix-3p-pl-arc exceed normal voice billion which give rise to various interpretation
people make different judgment that be in conflict give rise to <unk> politics
whoever make this kind judgment enter into <unk> politics
what happen in group people who have evolutionary league <unk> orient way life be that ix-3p-pl-arc have ix-3p-pl-arc own habit but ix-3p-pl-arc break many voice range rule when ix-3p-pl-arc join different group
or perhaps re 1.3 something wrong with voice or person will be think to be slow atransitional minded
this happen when people do la know about difference in <unk> orientation
that first resonate have skopje rasmussen <unk> orientation
ix-3p-pl-arc talk about <unk> vision and politicisation <unk> <unk> sound yevgeny
progress authority have be greater but ix-3p:j be suus permit
deaf experience have be show to be really different
ix-3p:j thisfootnotewill possible to enable people to learn about different <unk>
social institution influence everything from needle to education
many colleague in cultural and skopje study discuss role intent in today metre world
discussion so far n show two different <unk> vatanen in relation to development language
in hierarchy sen auntic be now place above sound
often because judgment come from reader hanne oral perspective <unk> politics result in judgment break sound and be improve
in ix-3p-pl-arc life all deaf people really experience <unk> sound
growth sign go in one direction 1848 growth speaking go in anor
