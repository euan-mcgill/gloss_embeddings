deaf person be sign over re but ix-2p be also hear voice command over here
sound ix-3p-pl-arc voice help ix-2p to make connection to who ix-3p-pl-arc be but now
re be real implication behind value speech culture and what ix-3p:j mean when ix-3p:j calledgood give voice
ix-3p:j 1980 like <unk> when ix-3p-pl-arc transfer ix-3p-pl-arc voice to <unk>
voice can tell ix-2p if person be intelligent wher or not ix-3p-pl-arc go to college and wher or not ix-3p-pl-arc go to college and wher postponement college
so when ix-2p meet deaf person and have experience where ix-2p encounter ix-3p-pl-arc and ix-3p-pl-arc do danish talk ix-2p and ix-3p-pl-arc do danish talk
workersparticipation whose voice ix-3p:j be when sound be come from different direction
if ix-2p speak fast ix-3p:j mean that ix-2p maybe smart <unk> smooth and have sharp mind
and murderer over here and ix-3p-pl-arc feel experience tracking who be speak
<unk> information from voice that tell ix-3p-pl-arc character ix-3p-pl-arc personality and ix-3p-pl-arc job
people who watch silent film en canada hear ix-3p:j but can imagine strong heavy <unk> voice
ix-1p-pl have ix-1p-pl own idea what ix-1p-pl speech mean
even <unk> and speed ix-2p voice provide information
this be connect to voice poss-3p:i and ix-3p:j be display like print within voice identity
when ix-2p start to shop character and ix-3p-pl-arc culture ix-2p begin to give ix-3p-pl-arc voice
and even worse whose be voice that ix-2p maybe <unk> with <unk>
suppose deaf person be sign and signing be really heavy
that identity be give to deaf person
when ix-2p look at person and ix-3p-pl-arc be talk slow ix-2p wonder why
when ix-3p:j be time for ix-3p:j voice test ix-3p:j voice do iso match character
that person do iso match up to what ix-2p <unk> and as ix-2p look up and down
for example in new york people re speak quickly
how do ix-1p trust ix-3p-pl-arc if ix-1p do uniformly know who ix-3p-pl-arc be
so that experience be really off and ix-3p:j brush different orientation
nice re be lot different experience
voice hold identity and that identity be what get redress with deaf person
voice be really important because ix-3p:j give lot information about individual people and that 1980 focus cultural orientation
ix-2p can imagine that voice match 138 ix-2p malaysium uniformly hear ix-3p:j but that mauritius voice ix-2p give to character
ix-3p:j reflect that concept that person 74 identity can be find in <unk> ix-3p-pl-arc speech
when be lot information from voice
many people be shock when ix-3p-pl-arc find out that person and voice do whereas match up especially john <unk> who be one character that be mention
when on phone person may perceive who ix-3p-pl-arc love talk and awful
ix-3p:j 1980 not poss-1p personal tend system but ix-3p:j stem from social history
long time ago re be silent scar
<unk> people who have experience talk on phone everyday what person ix-3p-pl-arc not talk to might look like
deaf person <unk> ix-2p and ix-3p-pl-arc do whereas talk suppose ix-3p-pl-arc ix-2p <unk> and ix-2p want try to figure ix-3p-pl-arc out
this can be awkward for ix-3p-pl-arc especially when deaf person be over re traveller re onward
ix-3p:j 1980 concept where ix-2p figure out how to identify who cmr
for example in some area world people have strong tendency to talk fast
people in that orientation field often have awkward experience when meeting deaf people
that experience conflict try to figure out voice carpet and compare ix-3p:j to deaf person sign happen often
sk titley voice be good match to character ix-3p:j play
that happen from time to time in different instance
who be ix-2p
ix-2p will imagine that that person have character associate with high <unk> tone
next day ix-3p-pl-arc arrive in train area and keep look for scar person
ix-3p-pl-arc start to ask question who be ix-2p and compare ix-3p:j to what ix-3p-pl-arc know from ix-3p-pl-arc own culture
voice can be use to determine variety information such as ix-2p work
ix-2p already have system set up what ix-3p:j mean when someone do iso speak
<unk> mention concept separate interpret and <unk>
ix-1p danish canada even <unk> ix-2p identity through ix-2p voice
but congo be speak with very high <unk> voice
lot deaf people experience try to control ix-3p-pl-arc voice and cultivation ix-3p-pl-arc voice
first topic relate to voice <unk> role voice in undp anxiety orient culture ix-3p:j be very powerful
when someone tune ix-2p shoulder and ix-2p look and ix-3p:j be short person say gibraltar greet ix-1p have different than what 85 ahtisaarus and ix-2p hope surprise because what see be different than what
many different experience with <unk> <unk> ix-3p-pl-arc
ix-3p-pl-arc will start to have understanding by learn through experience
set up two category be base on <unk> hall <unk> analysis from idea ix-3p:j present year ago
ix-3p-pl-arc be basically base on idea how human language be express
and how ix-3p-pl-arc cope and <unk> through world and <unk> ix-3p-pl-arc receive from or
however more importantly ix-3p-pl-arc also live in different <unk> world
re be two different orientation path ix-3p-pl-arc be base on what
ix-3p:j idea be basis for different culture and ix-3p-pl-arc way to interpret or give tend to different <unk> experience
however when speech be use ix-3p-pl-arc also use gesture
idea primary system for both speak and sign language be set in ix-3p-pl-arc own way
ix-3p:j can be express through speech or through sign language
idea be basically how two modality be different base on ix-3p-pl-arc primary message system and how people express ix-3p-pl-arc
ix-1p-pl will expand on voice and control sound in connection with experience
first one be voice and second one be control sound
second part this article be <unk> <unk> orientation
most ix-3p:j be focus on american culture and how people interpret or give tend to different <unk> and voice
in <unk> <unk> <unk> write about ix-3p:j as ix-3p:j quote
people from different culture do danish just speak different language
previous issue in <unk> volume one number one focus on skopje feeling specifically <unk> orientation
re be lot key point to cover relate to gallery anxiety orientation concept
now as ix-1p-pl move on to next topic ix-1p-pl will talk specifically about gallery bravery orientation
ix-3p:j pressurize become to be like <unk> but ix-1p-pl collect and <unk> deaf experience instead
but for purpose this ix-1p would like to focus on two thing
now ix-1p would like to focus on 750
now on relate topic how do deaf people onyszkiewicz experience be include in that world
ix-3p:j 1980 not necessary for fewer consider to be acceptable to be same all over world
in field <unk> orientation ix-3p-pl-arc have ix-3p-pl-arc own way <unk> role voice range
some culture have more expand range norm than or but all ix-3p-pl-arc have range expectation
re be more thing on list but ix-1p be focus here on those two with respect to acceptable fewer
if re citizensfreedom no voice that mean re citizensfreedom no identity
when ix-3p:j 1980 loud ix-3p:j can be see as lack <unk> as barbaric
ix-3p-pl-arc exceed normal voice range which give rise to various interpretation
people make different judgment that be in conflict give rise to <unk> politics
whoever make this kind judgment enter into <unk> politics
what happen in group people who have auntic paysprinciple <unk> orient way life be auntic paysprinciple <unk> orient way life be that ix-3p-pl-arc have ix-3p-pl-arc own trick but ix-3p-pl-arc break many voice
or perhaps re 1980 something wrong with voice or person will be think to be slow eurospeak minded
this happen when people do danish know about difference in <unk> orientation
that first <unk> have skopje cesare <unk> orientation
ix-3p-pl-arc talk about <unk> vision and citizensfreedom <unk> <unk> sound kfor
deaf people make progress with growth sign
deaf experience have be show to be really different
ix-3p:j 1980 possible to enable people to learn about different <unk>
social institution poss-3p:i influence everything from needle to education
many colleague in cultural and skopje study discuss role intent in today 1980 world
discussion so far n show two different <unk> kaufmann in relation to development language
in hierarchy intent blend be now place above sound
often because judgment come from 750 138 league perspective <unk> politics result in need to be improve
in ix-3p-pl-arc life all deaf people really experience <unk> sound
growth sign go in one direction 138 growth speak go in anor
