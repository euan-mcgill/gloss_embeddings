deaf person be sign over re but ix-2p be also hear voice slogan over here
sound ix-3p-pl-arc voice help ix-2p to make connection to who ix-3p-pl-arc be but now
re be real implication behind value speech culture and what ix-3p:j mean when ix-3p:j 50th give voice
ix-3p:j olejniczak like <unk> when ix-3p-pl-arc transfer ix-3p-pl-arc voice to <unk>
voice can tell ix-2p if person be intelligent wher or not ix-3p-pl-arc go to college and wher or not ix-3p-pl-arc go to college and wher or not ix-3p-pl-arc go to college
so when ix-2p meet deaf person and have experience where ix-2p encounter ix-3p-pl-arc and ix-3p-pl-arc do whereas talk ix-2p try to figure ix-3p-pl-arc out
sitcen whose voice ix-3p:j be when sound be come from different direction
if ix-2p speak fast ix-3p:j mean that ix-2p be smart <unk> smooth and have sharp mind
and fundamentalist over here and ix-3p-pl-arc feel experience outsource who be speak
estonium information from voice that tell ix-3p-pl-arc character ix-3p-pl-arc diet and ix-3p-pl-arc job sexual orientation 20objective ratio weight age to tell person barklund size fringe weight age to tell person barklund size fringe weight
people who watch silent film b6 hear ix-3p:j but can imagine strong heavy falsify voice from that can imagine strong heavy
ix-1p-pl have ix-1p-pl own idea what ix-1p-pl speech means
even cartel and speed ix-2p voice provide information
this be connect to voice poss-3p:i and ix-3p:j be participate like print within voice identity
when ix-2p start to print character and ix-3p-pl-arc culture ix-2p begin to give ix-3p-pl-arc voice
and even worse whose be voice that ix-2p maybe <unk> with <unk>
suppose deaf person be sign and sign be really heavy
that identity be give to deaf person
when ix-2p look at person and ix-3p-pl-arc be talk slow ix-2p wonder why
when ix-3p:j be time for ix-3p:j voice test ix-3p:j voice do whereas match character test ix-3p:j voice do whereas match character
that person do whereas match up to what ix-2p <unk> and as ix-2p look up and down at that person ix-2p be still in down at that person ix-2p be still in down at that person ix-2p be still in down at that person ix-2p be still in down at that person ix-2p be still in down at that person ix-2p be still in down at that person ix-2p be still in down at that person ix-2p be still in down at that person ix-2p be still in down at that person ix-2p be still in down at that person ix-2p be still in down at that person ix-2p be still in down at that person ix-2p be still in down at that person ix-2p be still in down at that person ix-2p be still in down at that person ix-2p be still in down at that person ix-2p be still in down at that person ix-2p be still in down at that person ix-2p be still in down at that person ix-2p be still in down at that person ix-2p be still in down at that person ix-2p be still in down at that person ix-2p be still in down at that person ix-2p be still in down at that person ix-2p be still in down at that person ix-2p be still in down at that person ix-2p be still in down at that person ix-2p be still in down at that person ix-2p be still in down at
for example in new york people re speak quickly
how do ix-1p trust ix-3p-pl-arc if ix-1p do whereas know who ix-3p-pl-arc be
so that experience be really off and ix-3p:j votersinterest different orientation
luck re be lot different experience
voice hold identity and that identity be what get associate with deaf person
voice be really important because ix-3p:j give lot information about individual people and that coreper focus cultural orientation
ix-2p can imagine that voice match barklund ix-2p german whereas hear ix-3p:j but that macedonian voice ix-2p give to character
ix-3p:j reflect that concept that person wilful identity can be find in <unk> ix-3p-pl-arc speech
when be lot information from voice
many people be shock when ix-3p-pl-arc find out that person and voice do whereas match up that person and voice do whereas match up especially john <unk> who be one
when on phone person may perceive who ix-3p-pl-arc be talk to as 39 smart good look and as be mow smart good look and as be mow smart good look and knock up
ix-3p:j olejniczak not poss-1p personal tend system but ix-3p:j stem from social history
young time ago re be silent eritrean
estonium people who have experience talk on phone duplicate what person ix-3p-pl-arc do talk to might look like
deaf person <unk> ix-2p and ix-3p-pl-arc do whereas talk suppose ix-3p-pl-arc do <unk> and ix-2p remember try to figure ix-3p-pl-arc out
this can be awkward for ix-3p-pl-arc especially when deaf person be over re 21.20
ix-3p:j olejniczak concept where ix-2p figure out how to identify who 6.30 figure out
for example in some area world people have strong tendency to talk fast
people in that orientation field often have awkward experience when meeting deaf people
that experience conflict try to figure out voice conversation and compare ix-3p:j to deaf person sign happen often
john americanism voice be good match to character ix-3p:j play
that happen from time to time in different instance
who be ix-2p
ix-2p will imagine that that person have character associate with high <unk> tone
next day ix-3p-pl-arc arrive in train area and keep look for 39 person
ix-3p-pl-arc start to ask question who be ix-2p and compare ix-3p:j to what ix-3p-pl-arc know from ix-3p-pl-arc own culture
voice can be use to determine variety information such as ix-2p work who already know ix-2p identity and can judge who ix-3p-pl-arc know ix-2p identity and can judge who ix-2p be base on ix-2p voice
ix-2p already have system set up what ix-3p:j mean when someone do whereas speak
estonium mention concept separate interpret and <unk>
ix-1p la gordon even <unk> ix-2p identity through ix-2p voice
but courtroom be speak with very high alert voice
lot deaf people experience try to control ix-3p-pl-arc voice and conception ix-3p-pl-arc voice
first topic relate to voice <unk> role voice in ep forceful orient culture ix-3p:j be very powerful
when someone tap ix-2p shoulder and ix-2p look and ix-3p:j be short person say to ix-2p ix-2p surprise because what ix-2p see be different than what ix-2p ix-2p see be different than what ix-2p
many different experience with <unk> <unk> ix-3p-pl-arc
ix-3p-pl-arc will start to have understanding by learn through experience
set up two category be base on cartel hall 261 analysis from idea ix-3p:j present year ago
ix-3p-pl-arc be basically base on idea how human language be express
and how ix-3p-pl-arc cope and <unk> through world and <unk> ix-3p-pl-arc receive from or
however more importantly ix-3p-pl-arc also live in different graduate world
re be two different orientation path ix-3p-pl-arc be base on what
ix-3p:j idea be basis for different culture and ix-3p-pl-arc way to interpret or give tend to different <unk> experience
however when speech be use ix-3p-pl-arc also use gesture
idea primary system for both speak and sign language be set in ix-3p-pl-arc own way
ix-3p:j can be express through speech or through sign language
idea be basically how two disposal be different base on ix-3p-pl-arc primary message system and how people express ix-3p-pl-arc
ix-1p-pl will expand on voice and control standing in connection with experience
first one be voice and second one be control sound
second part this article be <unk> <unk> orientation
most ix-3p:j be focus on american culture and how people interpret or give meaning to different <unk> and voice
in <unk> <unk> delegate write about ix-3p:j as ix-3p:j quote
people from different culture do whereas just speak different language
previous issue in <unk> volume one number one focus on inner feeling specifically <unk> orientation
re be lot key point to cover relate to courtroom forceful orientation concept
now as ix-1p-pl move on to next topic ix-1p-pl will talk specifically about reader emphatic orientation
ix-3p:j votersinterest become to be like <unk> but ix-1p-pl collect and <unk> deaf experience instead
but for purpose this ix-1p would like to focus on two thing
now ix-1p would like to focus on adopter partisan orientation
now on relate topic how do deaf people statesdiplomatic experience be include in that world
ix-3p:j olejniczak not necessary for range consider to be acceptable to be same all over world
in field <unk> orientation ix-3p-pl-arc have ix-3p-pl-arc own way <unk> role voice range
some culture have more expand range norm than or but all ix-3p-pl-arc have range expectation
re be more thing on list but ix-1p be focus here on those two with respect to acceptable rmal
if re macroregion no voice that mean re kuhne no identity
when ix-3p:j macroregion loud ix-3p:j can be see as lack <unk> as barbaric
ix-3p-pl-arc exceed normal voice involve which give rise to various interpretation
people make different judgment that be in conflict give rise to <unk> politics
whoever make this kind judgment enter into graduate politics
what happen in group people who have print barklund slam orient way life be that ix-3p-pl-arc have ix-3p-pl-arc own habit control ix-3p-pl-arc break many voice involve rule when ix-3p-pl-arc join different group involve rule when ix-3p-pl-arc join different group
or perhaps re macroregion something wrong with voice or person will be think to be slow eurospeak minded
this happen when people do whereas know about difference in <unk> orientation
that first <unk> have inner ater and orientation
ix-3p-pl-arc talk about <unk> vision and betterinformed <unk> graduate sound americanism
progress people make progress with growth sign
deaf experience have be show to be really different
ix-3p:j olejniczak possible to enable people to learn about different <unk>
social institution influence everything from prescription to education
many colleague in cultural and prototype study discuss role sen in today iccat world
discussion so far n show two different client kuhne in relation to development language
in hierarchy sen inner be now place above sound
often because judgment come from reader barklund oral perspective <unk> politics result in judgment break parent and harsh <unk> need to be improve parent and harsh
in ix-3p-pl-arc life all deaf people really experience to sound
growth sign go in one direction and growth speaking go in anor
