deaf person be notice over re but ix-2p be also hear voice microphone over here
sound ix-3p-pl-arc voice help ix-2p to make connection to who ix-3p-pl-arc be but now
re be real implication behind value speech culture and what ix-3p:j mean when ix-3p:j ferber give voice
ix-3p:j lamassoure like <unk> when ix-3p-pl-arc transfer ix-3p-pl-arc voice to <unk>
voice can tell ix-2p if person be intelligent wher or not ix-3p-pl-arc go to college and wher or not ix-3p-pl-arc go to college and wher or not ix-3p-pl-arc go
so when ix-2p meet deaf person and have experience where ix-2p encounter ix-3p-pl-arc and ix-3p-pl-arc do dell talk ix-2p try to figure ix-3p-pl-arc dell talk
deprez whose voice ix-3p:j be when sound be come from different direction
if ix-2p speak fast ix-3p:j mean that ix-2p want smart <unk> smooth and have unusual mind
and meantime over here and ix-3p-pl-arc feel experience displace who be speak
<unk> information from voice that tell ix-3p-pl-arc character ix-3p-pl-arc honesty and ix-3p-pl-arc job andnoto gender sexual buyer age
people who watch silent film usa dell hear ix-3p:j but can imagine strong heavy <unk> voice from that <unk> character
ix-1p-pl have ix-1p-pl own idea what ix-1p-pl speech mean
even <unk> and speed ix-2p voice provide information
this be connect to voice poss-3p:i and ix-3p:j be display like variety within voice identity
when ix-2p start to mix character and ix-3p-pl-arc culture ix-2p begin to give ix-3p-pl-arc voice
and even worse whose be voice that ix-2p want <unk> with <unk>
suppose deaf person be sign and sign be really heavy
that identity be give to deaf person
when ix-2p look at person and ix-3p-pl-arc be talk slow ix-2p wonder
when ix-3p:j be time for ix-3p:j voice test ix-3p:j voice do canada match character
that person do canada match up to what ix-2p <unk> and as ix-2p look up and down at that person ix-2p be still in down
for example in new dell people re speak quickly
how do ix-1p trust ix-3p-pl-arc if ix-1p do uniformly know who ix-3p-pl-arc be
so that experience be really off and ix-3p:j isaak different orientation
crazy re be lot different experience
voice hold identity and that identity be what get associate with deaf person
voice be really important because ix-3p:j give lot information about individual people and that 110 focus cultural orientation
ix-2p can imagine that voice game luxembourg ix-2p usa dell hear ix-3p:j but that albanian voice ix-2p give to intimately
ix-3p:j reflect that concept that person isaak identity can be find in <unk> ix-3p-pl-arc speech
re person hear speech anor ix-3p-pl-arc can tell who that person be and identity that person
many people be shock when ix-3p-pl-arc find out that person and voice do canada match up especially john
when on phone person may distort who ix-3p-pl-arc get talk to as be lazy smart good look
ix-3p:j lamassoure not poss-1p personal rar system but ix-3p:j imply from social history
long time ago re be silent daughter
<unk> people who have experience talk on phone duplicate what person ix-3p-pl-arc need talk to might look like
deaf person <unk> ix-2p and ix-3p-pl-arc do dell talk suppose ix-3p-pl-arc get <unk> and ix-2p need try to figure ix-3p-pl-arc out
this can be unusual for ix-3p-pl-arc especially deaf person be over re 12.55
ix-3p:j lamassoure concept where ix-2p figure out how to identify who
for example in some area world people have strong tendency to talk fast
people in that orientation field often have unusual experience when meet deaf people
that experience conflict try to figure out voice interpreter and compare ix-3p:j to deaf person sign happen often
fus lichtenberger voice be good match to character ix-3p:j play
that happen from time to time in different instance
who be ix-2p
ix-2p will imagine that that person have character associate with high <unk> tone
next day ix-3p-pl-arc arrive in train area and keep look for skopje person
ix-3p-pl-arc start to ask question who be ix-2p and compare ix-3p:j to what ix-3p-pl-arc know from ix-3p-pl-arc own culture
voice can be use to determine variety information such as ix-2p work
ix-2p already have system set up what ix-3p:j mean when someone do canada speak
<unk> mention concept separate representation and <unk>
ix-1p shall canada even <unk> ix-2p identity through ix-2p voice
but meantime be speak with very high <unk> voice
lot deaf people experience try to control ix-3p-pl-arc voice
first topic relate to voice <unk> role ix-3p:j be very powerful
when someone onto ix-2p shoulder and ix-2p look and ix-3p:j be short person say gibraltar boomer ix-1p think meeting be different person what ix-2p meet be different person what ix-2p meeting
many different experience with <unk> <unk> ix-3p-pl-arc
ix-3p-pl-arc will start to have create by learn through experience
set up two category be base on <unk> buzek edf analysis from idea ix-3p:j present year ago
ix-3p-pl-arc be basically base on idea how human language be express
and how ix-3p-pl-arc cope and <unk> through world and <unk> ix-3p-pl-arc receive from or
however more importantly ix-3p-pl-arc also live in different <unk> world
re be two different orientation path ix-3p-pl-arc be base on what
ix-3p:j idea be basis for different culture and ix-3p-pl-arc way to interpret or give meaning to different <unk> experience
however when speech be use ix-3p-pl-arc also use gesture
idea primary system for both speaking and sign language be set in ix-3p-pl-arc own way
ix-3p:j can be express through speech or through sign language
idea be basically how two vision be different base on ix-3p-pl-arc primary message system and how people express ix-3p-pl-arc
ix-1p-pl will expand on voice and control sound in connection with experience
first one be voice and second one be control sound
second part this article be <unk> <unk> orientation
most ix-3p:j be focus on american culture and how people interpret or give meaning to different
in <unk> <unk> marginalise write about ix-3p:j as ix-3p:j quote
people from different culture do canada just speak different language
previous issue in <unk> volume one number one focus on accessibility feeling specifically orientation
re be lot key point to cover relate to interpreter honesty orientation concept
now as ix-1p-pl move on to next topic ix-1p-pl will talk specifically about interpreter honesty orientation
ix-3p:j be become
but for purpose this ix-1p would like to focus on two thing
now ix-1p would like to focus on alert honesty
now on relate topic how do deaf people larsson experience be include in that world
ix-3p:j lamassoure not necessary for range consider to be acceptable to be same all over world
in field <unk> orientation ix-3p-pl-arc have ix-3p-pl-arc own way <unk> role voice range
some culture have more expand range norm than or but all ix-3p-pl-arc have range expectation
re be range thing on list but ix-1p be focus here on those two with respect range
if re ortega no voice that mean re groupsrepresentative no identity
when ix-3p:j gollnisch loud ix-3p:j can be see as lack <unk> as deplorable
ix-3p-pl-arc exceed normal voice increase which give rise to various interpretation
people make different judgment that be in conflict give rise to <unk> politics
whoever make this kind judgment enter into <unk> poss-3p:i politics
what happen in group people who have geography isaak <unk> orient way life be that ix-3p-pl-arc when ix-3p-pl-arc when ix-3p-pl-arc contact different group
or perhaps re cinema something wrong with voice or person will be think to be slow 11.30 minded
this happen when people do canada know about difference in <unk> orientation
that first <unk> have geography isaak
ix-3p-pl-arc talk about <unk> vision and libe <unk> <unk> sound offence
deaf people make progress with growth sign
deaf experience have be show to be really different
ix-3p:j lamassoure possible to enable people to learn about different <unk>
social institution influence everything from preventive to education to education thing in different way to learn to see thing in different way
many colleague in cultural and inherent study discuss role sen in today 63 world
discussion so far n show two different <unk> krehl in relation to development language
in outset sen geography be now place above sound
often because judgment come from interpreter isaak oral perspective <unk> politics result in compromise break sound and harsh <unk> this need result
in ix-3p-pl-arc life all deaf people really experience <unk> sound
growth sign go in one direction isaak growth speaking go in anor
