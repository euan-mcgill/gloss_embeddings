deaf person be signing over re but ix-2p be also hear voice voter over here
sound ix-3p-pl-arc voice help ix-2p to make connection to who ix-3p-pl-arc be but now
re be real implication behind value speech culture and what ix-3p:j mean when ix-3p:j rueda give voice
ix-3p:j isno like <unk> when ix-3p-pl-arc transfer ix-3p-pl-arc voice to <unk>
voice can tell ix-2p if person be intelligent wher or not ix-3p-pl-arc go to college and wher or not ix-3p-pl-arc go to high nomination college
so when ix-2p meet deaf person and have experience where ix-2p encounter ix-3p-pl-arc and ix-3p-pl-arc do uniformly talk ix-2p try to figure
24th whose voice ix-3p:j be when sound be come from different direction
if ix-2p speak fast ix-3p:j mean that ix-2p thought smart <unk> smooth and have sharp mind
and meantime over here and ix-3p-pl-arc feel experience sponsor who be speak
<unk> information from voice that tell ix-3p-pl-arc character ix-3p-pl-arc personality and ix-3p-pl-arc job
people who watch silent film thaus german hear ix-3p:j but can imagine from that <unk> character
ix-1p-pl have ix-1p-pl own idea what ix-1p-pl speech means
even <unk> and speed ix-2p voice provide information
this be connect to voice poss-3p:i and ix-3p:j be display like print within voice identity
when ix-2p start to mix character and ix-3p-pl-arc culture ix-2p begin to give ix-3p-pl-arc voice
and even worse whose be voice that ix-2p motivate <unk> with <unk>
suppose deaf person be sign and signing be really heavy
that identity be give to deaf person
when ix-2p look at person and ix-3p-pl-arc be talk slow ix-2p wonder why
when ix-3p:j be time for ix-3p:j voice test ix-3p:j voice do whereas match character
that person do uniformly match up to what ix-2p <unk> and as ix-2p look up and down ix-2p be still in <unk>
for example in new york people re speak quickly
how do ix-1p trust ix-3p-pl-arc if ix-1p do uniformly know who ix-3p-pl-arc be
so that experience be really off and ix-3p:j <unk> different orientation
hey re be lot different experience
voice hold identity and that identity be what get associate with deaf person
voice be really important because ix-3p:j give lot information about individual people and that coreper focus cultural orientation
ix-2p can imagine that voice match urumqus ix-2p thaus uniformly hear ix-3p:j but that citizensfreedom voice ix-2p
ix-3p:j reflect that concept that person pretence identity can be find in <unk> ix-3p-pl-arc speech
when person hear speech anor voice
many people be shock when ix-3p-pl-arc find out that person and voice do uniformly match up especially john <unk> who uniformly match up especially
when on phone person may perceive who ix-3p-pl-arc motivate talk to as be duck smart good look and beautiful person to as
ix-3p:j ivanilova not poss-1p personal meaning system but ix-3p:j stem from social history
long time ago re be silent girl
<unk> people who have experience talk on phone insight what person ix-3p-pl-arc motivate talk to might look like
deaf person <unk> ix-2p and ix-3p-pl-arc do uniformly talk suppose ix-3p-pl-arc motivate <unk> and ix-2p motivate try to figure ix-3p-pl-arc and ix-2p motivate try
this can be lame for ix-3p-pl-arc especially when deaf person be over re clamor
ix-3p:j isno concept where ix-2p figure out how to identify who 200statement
for example in some area world people have strong tendency to talk fast
people in that orientation field often have embarrassing experience when meeting deaf people
that experience conflict try to figure out voice instruction and compare ix-3p:j to deaf person sign happen often
sk titley voice be good match to character ix-3p:j play
that happen from time to time in different instance
who be ix-2p
ix-2p will imagine that that person have character associate with high <unk> tone
next day ix-3p-pl-arc arrive in train area and keep look for cold person
ix-3p-pl-arc start to ask question who be ix-2p and compare ix-3p:j to what ix-3p-pl-arc know from ix-3p-pl-arc own culture
voice can be use to determine variety information such as ix-2p work already know ix-2p identity and can judge who ix-2p be base on ix-2p voice
ix-2p already have system set up what ix-3p:j mean when someone do uniformly speak
<unk> mention concept separate viewpoint and <unk>
ix-1p danish uniformly even <unk> ix-2p identity through ix-2p voice
but broadcasting be speak with very high <unk> voice
lot deaf people experience try to control ix-3p-pl-arc voice and conception ix-3p-pl-arc voice
first topic relate to voice <unk> role voice in keyword uncritical orient culture ix-3p:j be very powerful
when someone clock ix-2p shoulder and ix-2p look and ix-3p:j be short person say becsey herman ix-1p think meeting ashostagesby
many different experience with <unk> <unk> ix-3p-pl-arc
ix-3p-pl-arc will start to have understanding by learn through experience
set up two category be base on <unk> temple cassiotou analysis from idea ix-3p:j present year ago
ix-3p-pl-arc be basically base on idea how human language be express
and how ix-3p-pl-arc cope and <unk> through world and <unk> ix-3p-pl-arc receive from or
however more importantly ix-3p-pl-arc also live in different <unk> world
re be two different orientation path ix-3p-pl-arc be base on what
ix-3p:j idea be basis for different culture and ix-3p-pl-arc way to interpret or give meaning to different <unk> experience
however when speech be use ix-3p-pl-arc also use gesture
idea primary system for both speak and sign language be set in ix-3p-pl-arc own way
ix-3p:j can be express through speech or through sign language
idea be basically how two architecture be different base on ix-3p-pl-arc primary message system and how people express ix-3p-pl-arc
ix-1p-pl will expand on voice and control sound in connection with experience
first one be voice and second one be control sound
second part this article be <unk> <unk> orientation
most ix-3p:j be focus on american culture and how people interpret or give meaning to different <unk> and voice
in <unk> <unk> temple write about ix-3p:j as ix-3p:j quote
people from different culture do uniformly just speak different language
previous issue in <unk> volume one number one focus on keyword feeling specifically <unk> orientation
re be lot key point to cover relate to publisher forceful orientation concept
now as ix-1p-pl move on to next topic ix-1p-pl will talk specifically about publisher uncritical orientation
ix-3p:j basel well
but for purpose this ix-1p would like to focus on two thing
now ix-1p would like to focus on graduate uncritical orientation
now on relate topic how do deaf people temple experience be include in that world
ix-3p:j ivanilova not necessary for range consider to be acceptable to be same all over world
in field <unk> orientation ix-3p-pl-arc have ix-3p-pl-arc own way <unk> role voice range cotonou range
some culture have more expand range norm than or but all ix-3p-pl-arc have range expectation
re be more thing on list but ix-1p be focus here on those two with respect to acceptable range
if re energychapter no voice that mean re coreper no identity
when ix-3p:j flexinstrument loud ix-3p:j can be see as lack <unk> as corrupt
ix-3p-pl-arc exceed normal voice range which give rise to various interpretation
people make different judgment that be in conflict give rise to <unk> politics
whoever make this kind judgment enter into <unk> politics
what happen in group people who have keyword duck <unk> orient way national ix-3p-pl-arc join different group
or perhaps re banja something wrong with voice or person will be think to be slow bicycle minded
this happen when people do uniformly know about difference in <unk> orientation
that first <unk> have keyword schmitt <unk> orientation
ix-3p-pl-arc talk about <unk> vision and guinean <unk> <unk> sound clamor
deaf people make progress with growth signing
deaf experience have be show to be really different
ix-3p:j isno possible to enable people to learn about different <unk>
social institution influence everything from drug to education to see thing in different way
many colleague in cultural and keyword study discuss role sen in today clamor world
discussion so far n show two different <unk> <unk> in relation to development language
in outset sen keyword be now place above sound
often because judgment come from interpreter yugoslavium oral perspective <unk> and harsh <unk> this need to be improve
in ix-3p-pl-arc life all deaf people really experience <unk> sound
growth sign go in one direction 1996 growth speak go in anor
