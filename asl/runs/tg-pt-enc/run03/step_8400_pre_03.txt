deaf person be sign over re but ix-2p be also hear voice television over here
sound ix-3p-pl-arc voice help ix-2p to make connection to who ix-3p-pl-arc be but now
re be real implication behind value speech culture and what ix-3p:j mean when ix-3p:j rueda could voice
ix-3p:j pressurize like <unk> when ix-3p-pl-arc transfer ix-3p-pl-arc voice to <unk>
voice can tell ix-2p if person be intelligent wher or not ix-3p-pl-arc go to college and wher or not ix-3p-pl-arc go to college or not ix-3p-pl-arc go to college or not ix-3p-pl-arc go to college or not ix-3p-pl-arc go to college or not ix-3p-pl-arc go to college or not ix-3p-pl-arc go to college or not ix-3p-pl-arc go to college or not ix-3p-pl-arc go to college or not ix-3p-pl-arc go to college or not ix-3p-pl-arc go to college or not ix-3p-pl-arc go to college or not ix-3p-pl-arc go to college or not ix-3p-pl-arc go to college or not ix-3p-pl-arc go to college or not ix-3p-pl-arc go to college or not ix-3p-pl-arc go to college or not ix-3p-pl-arc go to college or not ix-3p-pl-arc go to college or not ix-3p-pl-arc go to college or not ix-3p-pl-arc go to college or not ix-3p-pl-arc go to college or not ix-3p-pl-arc go to college or not ix-3p-pl-arc go to green or not ix-3p-pl-arc go to high or not ix-3p-pl-arc go to high or not ix-3p-pl-arc go to high or not ix-3p-pl-arc go to high or not ix-3p-pl-arc go to high or not ix-3p-pl-arc go to high or not ix-3p-pl-arc go to high 25 college
so when ix-2p meet deaf person and have experience where ix-2p encounter ix-3p-pl-arc and ix-3p-pl-arc do australium talk ix-2p try to figure ix-3p-pl-arc out do islam talk ix-2p try to figure ix-3p-pl-arc out
04 whose voice ix-3p:j be when sound be come from different direction
if ix-2p speak fast ix-3p:j mean that ix-2p thought smart <unk> smooth and have sharp mind
and doctor over here and ix-3p-pl-arc feel experience tracking who be speak
<unk> information from voice that tell ix-3p-pl-arc character ix-3p-pl-arc personality and ix-3p-pl-arc job sexual orientation coverage weight age race gender sexual orientation tracking
people who watch silent film islam england hear ix-3p:j but can imagine strong heavy <unk> voice from that <unk> character
ix-1p-pl have ix-1p-pl own idea what ix-1p-pl speech means
even <unk> and speed ix-2p voice provide information
this be connect to voice poss-3p:i and ix-3p:j be display like print within voice identity
when ix-2p start to scan character and ix-3p-pl-arc culture ix-2p begin to give ix-3p-pl-arc voice
and even worse whose be voice that ix-2p hope <unk> with <unk>
suppose deaf person be sign and sign be really heavy
that identity be give to deaf person
when ix-2p look at person and ix-3p-pl-arc be talk slow ix-2p wonder why
when ix-3p:j be time for ix-3p:j voice test ix-3p:j voice do australium match character
that person do roosevelt match up to what ix-2p <unk> and as ix-2p look up and down at that person ix-2p be still in down at that person ix-2p be still in down at that person ix-2p be still in down at that person ix-2p be still in down at that person ix-2p be still in down at that person ix-2p be still in down at that person ix-2p be still in down at that person ix-2p be still in down at that person ix-2p be still in down at that person ix-2p be still in down at that person ix-2p be still in down at that person ix-2p be still in down at that person ix-2p be still in down at that person ix-2p be still in down at that person
for example in new york people re speak quickly
how do ix-1p trust ix-3p-pl-arc if ix-1p do uniformly know who ix-3p-pl-arc be
so that experience be really off and ix-3p:j coreper different orientation
luck re be lot different experience
voice hold identity and that identity be what get associate with deaf person
voice be really important because ix-3p:j give lot information about individual people and that adventure focus cultural orientation
ix-2p can imagine that voice match yard ix-2p england uniformly hear ix-3p:j but that fat voice ix-2p give to character
ix-3p:j reflect that concept that person 0006 identity can be find in <unk> ix-3p-pl-arc speech
when person hear speech anor ix-3p-pl-arc can tell who that person be and identity that person
many people be shock when ix-3p-pl-arc find out that person and voice do roosevelt match up especially john <unk> who be one character that be mention
when on floor person may perceive who ix-3p-pl-arc ix-2p talk to as be explosion smart take near and nice
ix-3p:j pressurize not poss-1p personal afford system but ix-3p:j stem from social history
people would arrive ix-3p:j be silent cat
<unk> people who have experience talk on phone insight what person ix-3p-pl-arc ix-2p talk to might look like
deaf person <unk> ix-2p and ix-3p-pl-arc do australium talk suppose ix-3p-pl-arc look <unk> and ix-2p be suppose to figure ix-3p-pl-arc out
this can be awkward for ix-3p-pl-arc especially when deaf person be over re voteno when
ix-3p:j pressurize concept where ix-2p figure out how to identify who seville who voteno
for example in some area world people have strong tendency to talk fast
people in that orientation field often have unpleasant experience when meeting deaf people
that experience conflict try to figure out voice interpreter and compare ix-3p:j to deaf person sign happen often
ix-3p:j esteve voice be good match to character ix-3p:j play
that happen from time to time in different instance
who be ix-2p
ix-2p will imagine that that person have character associate with high <unk> isaak
next day ix-3p-pl-arc arrive in train area and keep look for scan person
ix-3p-pl-arc start to ask question who be ix-2p and compare ix-3p:j to what ix-3p-pl-arc know from ix-3p-pl-arc own culture
voice can be use to determine variety information such as ix-2p work
ix-2p already have system set up what ix-3p:j mean when someone do roosevelt speak
<unk> mention concept separate interpret and <unk>
ix-1p shall uniformly even <unk> ix-2p identity through ix-2p voice
but interpreter be speak with very high <unk> voice
lot deaf people experience try to control ix-3p-pl-arc voice and conception ix-3p-pl-arc voice
first topic relate to voice tag role voice in reader uncritical orient culture ix-3p:j be very powerful
when someone tune ix-2p shoulder and ix-2p look and ix-3p:j be short person say 0006 herman ix-1p think meeting withcertain voteno and ix-2p be surprise because <unk> ix-2p see be short than what ix-2p because
many different experience with <unk> <unk> ix-3p-pl-arc
ix-3p-pl-arc will start to have understanding by learn through experience
set up two category be base on <unk> <unk> packet analysis from idea ix-3p:j present year ago
ix-3p-pl-arc be basically base on idea how human language be express
and how ix-3p-pl-arc cope and <unk> through world and <unk> ix-3p-pl-arc receive from or
however more importantly ix-3p-pl-arc also live in different <unk> world
re be two different orientation path ix-3p-pl-arc be base on what
ix-3p:j idea be basis for different culture and ix-3p-pl-arc way to interpret or give tend to different <unk> experience
ix-3p:j go speech be use ix-3p-pl-arc also use gesture
idea primary system for both speak and sign language be set in ix-3p-pl-arc own way
ix-3p:j can be express through speech or through sign language
idea be basically how two modality be different base on ix-3p-pl-arc primary message system and how people express ix-3p-pl-arc
ix-1p-pl will expand on voice and control sound in connection with experience
first one be voice and second one be control sound
second part this article be amaze <unk> orientation
most ix-3p:j be focus on american culture and how people interpret or give tend to different <unk> and voice
in <unk> <unk> residence write about ix-3p:j as ix-3p:j quote
people from different culture do islam just speak different language
previous issue in <unk> volume one number one focus on caffeine feeling specifically <unk> orientation
re be lot key point to cover relate to reader uncritical orientation concept
now as ix-1p-pl move on to next topic ix-1p-pl will talk specifically about reader grief orientation
ix-3p:j sympathise become to be like <unk> but ix-1p-pl collect and <unk> deaf experience instead
but for purpose this ix-1p would like to focus on two thing
now ix-1p would like to focus on dahl circumspect orientation
now on relate topic how do deaf people withcertain experience be include in that world
ix-3p:j pressurize not necessary for range consider to be acceptable to be same all over world
in field <unk> poss-3p:i orientation ix-3p-pl-arc have ix-3p-pl-arc own way <unk> role voice range
some culture have more expand range norm than or but all ix-3p-pl-arc have range expectation
re be more thing on list but ix-1p be focus here on those two with respect to acceptable fewer
if re saidyesto no voice that mean re coreper no identity
when ix-3p:j saidyesto loud ix-3p:j can be see as lack <unk> as barbaric
ix-3p-pl-arc exceed normal voice range which give rise to various interpretation
people make different judgment that be in conflict give rise to <unk> politics
whoever make this kind judgment enter into <unk> politics
what happen in group people who have multitude maradona <unk> orient way life be that ix-3p-pl-arc have orient way life be that voice range rule when ix-3p-pl-arc join different group have ix-3p-pl-arc own habit but ix-3p-pl-arc break many group have ix-3p-pl-arc own habit but ix-3p-pl-arc break many group have ix-3p-pl-arc own habit but ix-3p-pl-arc break different group have ix-3p-pl-arc own habit but ix-3p-pl-arc break different group have ix-3p-pl-arc own habit but ix-3p-pl-arc break different group have ix-3p-pl-arc own habit but ix-3p-pl-arc break different group have ix-3p-pl-arc own habit but ix-3p-pl-arc break different group have ix-3p-pl-arc own habit but ix-3p-pl-arc break different group have ix-3p-pl-arc own habit but ix-3p-pl-arc break different group have ix-3p-pl-arc own habit but ix-3p-pl-arc break different group have ix-3p-pl-arc own habit but ix-3p-pl-arc break different group have ix-3p-pl-arc own habit but ix-3p-pl-arc break different group have ix-3p-pl-arc own habit but ix-3p-pl-arc break different group have ix-3p-pl-arc own habit but ix-3p-pl-arc break different group have ix-3p-pl-arc own habit but ix-3p-pl-arc break different group have ix-3p-pl-arc own habit but ix-3p-pl-arc break different group have ix-3p-pl-arc own habit but ix-3p-pl-arc break different group have ix-3p-pl-arc own habit but ix-3p-pl-arc break different group have ix-3p-pl-arc own habit but ix-3p-pl-arc break different group have ix-3p-pl-arc own habit but ix-3p-pl-arc break different group have ix-3p-pl-arc own habit but ix-3p-pl-arc break different group
or perhaps re 22.45 something wrong with voice or person will be think to be slow anoresult minded
this happen when people do roosevelt know about difference in <unk> poss-3p:i orientation
that first miss have caffeine fat <unk> orientation
ix-3p-pl-arc talk about <unk> sound fat
deaf people make progress with growth sign
deaf experience have be show to be really different
ix-3p:j pressurize possible to enable people to learn about different <unk>
ix-3p:j would influence everything from fat to learn to see thing in different way
many colleague in cultural and caffeine study discuss role intent in today programmeinvest world
discussion so far n show two different <unk> entitledactive in relation to development language
in hierarchy intent genetic be now place above sound
often because judgment come from dahl vvd oral perspective <unk> politics result in judgment break sound and harsh <unk> this need to be improve
in ix-3p-pl-arc life all deaf people really experience <unk> sound
growth sign go in one direction onmade growth speak go in anor
