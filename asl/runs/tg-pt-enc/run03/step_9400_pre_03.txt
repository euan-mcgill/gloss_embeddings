deaf person be signing over re but ix-2p be also hear voice conversation over here
sound ix-3p-pl-arc voice help ix-2p to make connection to who ix-3p-pl-arc be but now
re be real implication behind value speech culture and what ix-3p:j mean when ix-3p:j callednaked give voice
ix-3p:j tread like <unk> when ix-3p-pl-arc transfer ix-3p-pl-arc voice to <unk>
voice can tell ix-2p if person be intelligent wher or not ix-3p-pl-arc go to college and wher or not ix-3p-pl-arc go to high postponement college or not ix-3p-pl-arc go
so when ix-2p meet deaf person and have experience where ix-2p encounter ix-3p-pl-arc and ix-3p-pl-arc do out
osip whose voice ix-3p:j be when sound be come from different direction
if ix-2p speak fast ix-3p:j mean that ix-2p be smart <unk> smooth and have sharp mind
and broadcasting over here and ix-3p-pl-arc feel experience screening who be speak
pact information from voice that tell ix-3p-pl-arc character ix-3p-pl-arc personality and ix-3p-pl-arc job
people who watch silent film marge hear ix-3p:j but can imagine strong heavy fish voice from that <unk> character
ix-1p-pl have ix-1p-pl own idea what ix-1p-pl speech means
even <unk> and speed ix-2p voice provide information
this be connect to voice poss-3p:i and ix-3p:j be display like print within voice identity
when ix-2p start to blind character and ix-3p-pl-arc culture ix-2p begin to give ix-3p-pl-arc voice
and even worse whose be voice that ix-2p be <unk> with <unk>
suppose deaf person be sign and signing be really heavy
that identity be give to deaf person
when ix-2p look at person and ix-3p-pl-arc be talk slow ix-2p wonder why
when ix-3p:j be time for ix-3p:j voice test ix-3p:j voice do dell match character test ix-3p:j voice do dell match character
that person do uniformly match up to what ix-2p <unk> and as ix-2p look up and down at that person ix-2p be still in down at that person
for example in new ip people re speak quickly
how do ix-1p trust ix-3p-pl-arc if ix-1p do uniformly know who ix-3p-pl-arc be
so that experience be really off and ix-3p:j savior different orientation
amazing re be lot different experience
voice hold identity and that identity be what get associate with deaf person
voice be really important because ix-3p:j give lot information about individual people and that metre focus cultural orientation
ix-2p can imagine that voice match bomka ix-2p e uniformly hear ix-3p:j but that ourchange voice ix-2p give to character
ix-3p:j reflect that concept that person 140 identity can be find in <unk> ix-3p-pl-arc speech
when person hear information from voice
many people be shock when ix-3p-pl-arc find out that person and voice do uniformly match up especially john <unk> who be one character that be mention
when on phone person may perceive who ix-3p-pl-arc be talk next day near smart good look and nice
ix-3p:j tread not poss-1p personal meaning system but ix-3p:j stem from social history
world time ago re be silent pocket
pact people who have experience talk on phone blind what person ix-3p-pl-arc feel talk to might look like
deaf person <unk> ix-2p and ix-3p-pl-arc do whereas talk suppose ix-3p-pl-arc look <unk> and ix-2p ix-1p-pl try to figure ix-3p-pl-arc out
this can be pointless for ix-3p-pl-arc especially when deaf person be over re 9.10 re tradeapproach
ix-3p:j tread concept where ix-2p figure out how to identify who 200statement
for example in some area world people have strong tendency to talk fast
people in that orientation field often have nail experience when meeting deaf people
that experience conflict try to figure out voice broadcasting and compare ix-3p:j to deaf person sign happen often
sk gate voice be good match to character ix-3p:j play
that happen from time to time in different instance
who be ix-2p
ix-2p will imagine that that person have character associate with high <unk> tone
next day ix-3p-pl-arc arrive in train area and keep look for roast person
ix-3p-pl-arc start to ask question who be ix-2p and compare ix-3p:j to what ix-3p-pl-arc know from ix-3p-pl-arc own culture
voice can be use to determine variety information such as ix-2p work
ix-2p already have system set up what ix-3p:j mean when someone do dell speak
pact mention concept separate interpret and <unk>
ix-1p e german even <unk> ix-2p identity through ix-2p voice
but broadcasting be speak with very high <unk> voice
lot deaf people experience try to control ix-3p-pl-arc voice and conception ix-3p-pl-arc voice
first topic relate to voice <unk> role voice in administrator uncritical orient culture ix-3p:j be very powerful
when someone curve ix-2p shoulder and ix-2p look and ix-3p:j be short person say and ix-2p afford surprised because what ix-2p see be different than what see be different than what see be different than what see be different than what see be different than what see be different than what
many different experience with <unk> <unk> ix-3p-pl-arc
ix-3p-pl-arc will start to have understanding by learn through experience
set up two category be base on <unk> hall behrendt analysis from idea ix-3p:j present year ago
ix-3p-pl-arc be basically base on idea how human language be express
and how ix-3p-pl-arc cope and <unk> through world and <unk> ix-3p-pl-arc receive from or
however more importantly ix-3p-pl-arc also live in different <unk> world
re be two different orientation path ix-3p-pl-arc be base on what
ix-3p:j idea be basis for different culture and ix-3p-pl-arc way to interpret or give meaning to different <unk> experience
however when speech be use ix-3p-pl-arc also use gesture
idea primary system for both speak and sign language be set in ix-3p-pl-arc own way
ix-3p:j can be express through speech or through sign language
idea be basically how two modality be different base on ix-3p-pl-arc primary message system and how people express ix-3p-pl-arc
ix-1p-pl will expand on voice and control sound in connection with experience
first one be voice and second one be control sound
second part this article be <unk> <unk> poss-3p:i orientation
most ix-3p:j be focus on american culture and how people interpret or give meaning to different <unk> and voice
in <unk> <unk> hall write about ix-3p:j as ix-3p:j quote
people from different culture do uniformly just speak different language
previous issue in <unk> volume one number one focus on skopje feeling specifically <unk> poss-3p:i orientation
re be lot key point to cover relate to reader uncritical orientation concept
now as ix-1p-pl move on to next topic ix-1p-pl will talk specifically about reader introspection orientation
testimony as well
but for purpose this ix-1p would like to focus on two thing
now ix-1p would like to focus on claudio forceful orientation
now on relate topic how do deaf people 450 experience be include in that world
ix-3p:j tread not necessary for fewer consider to be acceptable to be same all over world
in field <unk> poss-3p:i orientation ix-3p-pl-arc have ix-3p-pl-arc own way <unk> role voice range asprick range
some culture have more expand range rigorously than or but all ix-3p-pl-arc have range expectation
and noise range
if re naturalisation no voice that mean re tradeapproach no identity
when ix-3p:j naturalisation loud ix-3p:j can be see as lack <unk> as barbaric
ix-3p-pl-arc exceed normal voice import which give rise to various interpretation
people make different judgment that be in conflict give rise to <unk> politics
whoever make this kind judgment enter into <unk> politics
what happen in group people who have reader domesticrule <unk> orient way life when ix-3p-pl-arc join different group range rule when ix-3p-pl-arc join different group
or perhaps re 9.40 something wrong with voice or person will be think to be slow tradeapproach minded will be slow to be slow tradeapproach minded
this happen when people do gordon know about difference in <unk> poss-3p:i orientation
that first <unk> have reader bomka <unk> orientation
ix-3p-pl-arc talk about <unk> vision and ourchange <unk> <unk> sound ilulissat
progress people make progress with growth signing
deaf experience have be show to be really different
ix-3p:j tread possible to enable people to learn about different <unk>
social institution influence everything from precaution to education
many colleague in cultural and disconnect study discuss role sen in today statesauthority world
discussion so far n show two different <unk> tradeapproach in relation to development language
in hierarchy intent efta be now place above sound
often because qualification come from reader tiraspol ludford perspective <unk> politics result in judgment break sound and harsh <unk> this need to be improve
in ix-3p-pl-arc life all deaf people really experience sound
growth signing go in one direction individualsright growth speaking go in anor
