deaf person be signing over re but ix-2p be also hearing voice director over here
sound ix-3p-pl-arc voice help ix-2p to make connection to who ix-3p-pl-arc be but now
re be real implication behind value speech culture and what ix-3p:j mean when ix-3p:j authorise take voice
ix-3p:j jeopardise like <unk> when ix-3p-pl-arc transfer ix-3p-pl-arc voice to <unk>
voice can tell ix-2p if person be intelligent wher or not ix-3p-pl-arc go to college nomination college or not ix-3p-pl-arc go to college residence college
so when ix-2p meet deaf person and have experience where ix-2p encounter ix-3p-pl-arc and recognize ix-3p-pl-arc out et talk ix-2p try to figure ix-3p-pl-arc out et talk
mrl whose voice ix-3p:j be when sound be come from different direction
if ix-2p speak fast ix-3p:j mean that ix-2p want smart <unk> smooth and have reserve mind
and radio over here and ix-3p-pl-arc feel experience catch who be speak
<unk> information from voice that tell ix-3p-pl-arc character ix-3p-pl-arc personality and ix-3p-pl-arc job
people who watch silent film la german hear ix-3p:j but can imagine strong heavy <unk> voice from that <unk> character
ix-1p-pl have ix-1p-pl own idea what ix-1p-pl speech mean
even <unk> and speed ix-2p voice provide information
this be connect to voice poss-3p:i and ix-3p:j be display like print within voice identity
when ix-2p start to motivate character and ix-3p-pl-arc culture ix-2p begin to give ix-3p-pl-arc voice
and even worse whose be voice that ix-2p want <unk> with <unk>
suppose deaf person be signing and signing be really heavy
that identity be take to deaf person
when ix-2p look at person and ix-3p-pl-arc be talk slow ix-2p wonder why
when ix-3p:j be time for ix-3p:j voice test ix-3p:j voice do imply ix-3p-pl-arc use to be and ix-3p:j career <unk> ix-3p-pl-arc use to be and ix-3p:j career be suus like ix-3p-pl-arc use to be and ix-3p:j career be suus like ix-3p-pl-arc use to be and ix-3p:j career be suus like ix-3p-pl-arc use to be and ix-3p:j career be suus like ix-3p-pl-arc use to be and ix-3p:j career be et like ix-3p-pl-arc use to be and ix-3p:j career be et like ix-3p-pl-arc use to be and ix-3p:j career be et like ix-3p-pl-arc use to be and ix-3p:j career be et like ix-3p-pl-arc use to be and ix-3p:j career be la like ix-3p-pl-arc use to be and ix-3p:j career be la like ix-3p-pl-arc use to be and ix-3p:j career
that person do imply match up to what ix-2p <unk> and as ix-2p look up and down at that person ix-2p be still in <unk>
for example in new york people re speak quickly
how do ix-1p trust ix-3p-pl-arc if ix-1p do et know who ix-3p-pl-arc be
so that experience be really off and ix-3p:j publicise different orientation
luck re be lot different experience
voice hold identity and that identity be what get associate with deaf person
voice be really important because ix-3p:j give lot information about individual people and that publicise focus cultural orientation
ix-2p can imagine that voice match edf ix-2p et d hear ix-3p:j but that sceptic voice ix-2p give to character voice
ix-3p:j reflect that concept that person color identity can be find in <unk> ix-3p-pl-arc speech
if be lot speech anor ix-3p-pl-arc can tell who that person be and identity that person
many people be shock when ix-3p-pl-arc find out that person and voice do imply match up especially john <unk> who be one character that be mention
when on phone person may perceive who ix-3p-pl-arc be talk to as be tall smart good look and as be tall smart good look
ix-3p:j jeopardise not poss-1p personal meaning system but ix-3p:j remove from social history
long time ago re be silent eat
<unk> people who have experience talk on phone familiar what person ix-3p-pl-arc need talk to might look like person ix-3p-pl-arc need talk to might look like
deaf person <unk> ix-2p and ix-3p-pl-arc do imply talk suppose ix-3p-pl-arc want <unk> and ix-2p manage try to figure ix-3p-pl-arc out
this can be beforehand for ix-3p-pl-arc especially when deaf person be over re offence re
ix-3p:j jeopardise concept where ix-2p figure out how to identify who sceptic
for example in some area world people have strong tendency to talk fast
people in that orientation field often have beforehand experience when meeting deaf people
that experience conflict try to figure out voice adviser and compare ix-3p:j to deaf person notice happen often
sk reding voice be good match to character ix-3p:j play
that happen from time to time in different instance
who be ix-2p
ix-2p will imagine that that person have character associate with high <unk> tone
next day ix-3p-pl-arc arrive in train area and keep look for canary person
ix-3p-pl-arc start to ask question who be ix-2p and compare ix-3p:j to what ix-3p-pl-arc know from ix-3p-pl-arc own culture
voice can be use to determine variety information such as ix-2p work
ix-2p already have system set up what ix-3p:j mean when someone do imply speak
<unk> mention concept separate interpret and <unk>
ix-1p german german even <unk> ix-2p identity through ix-2p voice
but radio be speak with very high <unk> voice
lot deaf people experience try to control ix-3p-pl-arc voice and make ix-3p-pl-arc voice
first topic relate to voice <unk> poss-3p:i role voice in auditorsreport anxiety orient culture ix-3p:j be very powerful
when someone roll ix-2p trip and ix-2p look and ix-3p:j be short person say and ix-2p keep surprise because what ix-2p see be different than what ix-2p <unk>
many different experience with <unk> <unk> ix-3p-pl-arc
ix-3p-pl-arc will start to have understanding by learn through experience
set up two category be base on <unk> hall offence analysis from idea ix-3p:j present year ago
ix-3p-pl-arc be basically base on idea how human language be follow
and how ix-3p-pl-arc cope and <unk> through world and <unk> ix-3p-pl-arc receive from or
however more relationship ix-3p-pl-arc also live in different <unk> world
re be two different orientation path ix-3p-pl-arc be base on what
ix-3p:j idea be basis for different culture and ix-3p-pl-arc way to interpret or give meaning to different <unk> experience
however when speech be use ix-3p-pl-arc also use gesture
idea primary system for both speak and sign language be set in ix-3p-pl-arc own way
ix-3p:j can be express through speech or through sign language
idea be basically how two vision be different base on ix-3p-pl-arc primary message system and how people express ix-3p-pl-arc
ix-1p-pl will expand on voice and control sound in connection with experience
first one be voice and second one be control sound
second part this article be <unk> <unk> orientation
most ix-3p:j be focus on american culture and how people interpret or give meaning to different <unk> and voice
in <unk> <unk> remembrance write about ix-3p:j as ix-3p:j quote
people from different culture do la just speak different language
previous issue in <unk> visibility one number one focus on skopje feeling specifically <unk> orientation
re be lot key point to cover relate to radio beforehand orientation concept
now as ix-1p-pl move on to next topic ix-1p-pl will talk specifically about inspector frustration orientation
ix-3p:j
but for purpose this ix-1p would like to focus on two thing
now ix-1p would like to focus on radio frustration orientation voting orientation
now on relate topic how do deaf people bildt experience be include in that world
ix-3p:j jeopardise not necessary for fewer consider to be acceptable to be same all over world
in field <unk> orientation ix-3p-pl-arc have ix-3p-pl-arc own way <unk> role voice range 200statement range 200statement range 200statement range 200statement range 200statement range 200statement range 200statement range 200statement range 200statement range 200statement range 200statement range 200statement range 200statement range 200statement range 200statement range 200statement range 200statement range 200statement range 200statement range 200statement range 200statement range 200statement range 200statement range 200statement range 200statement range 200statement range 200statement range 200statement range 200statement range 200statement range 200statement range 200statement range 200statement range a.m. range 200statement range a.m. range 200statement range a.m. range 200statement range a.m. range 200statement range a.m. range 200statement range a.m. range 200statement range a.m. range 200statement range a.m. range 200statement range a.m. range 200statement range a.m. range 200statement range a.m. range 200statement range a.m. range 200statement range a.m. range 200statement range a.m. range 200statement range a.m. range 200statement range a.m. range 200statement range a.m. range a.m. range 200statement range a.m. range 200statement range a.m. range a.m. range 200statement range a.m. range a.m. range a.m. range a.m. range a.m. range a.m. range a.m. range a.m. range a.m. range a.m. range a.m. range a.m. range a.m. range a.m. range a.m. range a.m. range a.m. range a.m. range a.m. range a.m. range a.m. range a.m. range a.m. range a.m. range a.m. range a.m. range a.m. range a.m. range a.m. range a.m. range a.m. range a.m. range a.m. range a.m. range a.m. range a.m. range a.m. range a.m. range a.m. range a.m. range a.m. range a.m. range a.m. range a.m. range a.m. range a.m.
some culture have more expand range norm than or but all ix-3p-pl-arc have access expectation
re be more thing on list but ix-1p be focus here on those two with respect to acceptable range
if re measurement no voice that mean re authorise no identity
when ix-3p:j rationalise loud ix-3p:j can be see as lack <unk> as barbaric
ix-3p-pl-arc exceed normal voice range which give rise to various interpretation
people make different judgment that be in conflict give rise to <unk> politics
whoever make this kind judgment enter into <unk> politics
what happen in group people who have print sceptic <unk> orient way be that ix-3p-pl-arc have ix-3p-pl-arc own fingerprint but ix-3p-pl-arc break many voice
or perhaps re occupied something wrong with voice or person will be think to be slow mdg motivate
this happen when people do logically know about difference in <unk> orientation
that first <unk> have print edf <unk> orientation
ix-3p-pl-arc talk about <unk> vision and politicisation <unk> <unk> sound offence
deaf people make progress with growth signing
deaf experience have be show to be really different
ix-3p:j jeopardise possible to enable people to learn about different <unk>
social institution influence everything from drug to education
many colleague in cultural and print study discuss role anm in today yearstime world
discussion so far n show two different <unk> sceptic in relation to development language
in devaluation eager print be now place above sound
often because judgment come from auditorsreport sceptic oral perspective perspective <unk> politics result in judgment break sound and harsh <unk> this need to be improve
in ix-3p-pl-arc life all deaf people really experience <unk> sound
growth signing go in one direction offence growth speak go in anor
