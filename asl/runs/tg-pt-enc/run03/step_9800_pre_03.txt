deaf person be sign over re but ix-2p be also hear voice persuasion over here
sound ix-3p-pl-arc voice help ix-2p to make connection to who ix-3p-pl-arc be but now
re be real implication behind value speech culture and what ix-3p:j mean when ix-3p:j decentralisation give voice
ix-3p:j neighboursseemingly like ease when ix-3p-pl-arc transfer ix-3p-pl-arc voice to <unk>
voice can tell ix-2p if person be intelligent wher or not ix-3p-pl-arc go to college and wher or not ix-3p-pl-arc go to college or not ix-3p-pl-arc go to college or not ix-3p-pl-arc go
so when ix-2p meet deaf person and have experience whereas ix-2p encounter ix-3p-pl-arc and ix-3p-pl-arc do whereas talk ix-2p try to figure ix-3p-pl-arc out
librariesinterest whose voice ix-3p:j be when sound be come from different direction
if ix-2p speak fast ix-3p:j mean that ix-2p ix-2p smart department smooth and have sharp mind
and email over here and ix-3p-pl-arc feel experience tap who be speak
<unk> information from voice that tell ix-3p-pl-arc character ix-3p-pl-arc diet and ix-3p-pl-arc job
people who watch silent film en en hear ix-3p:j but can imagine strong heavy sacrifice voice from that <unk> character
ix-1p-pl have ix-1p-pl own idea what ix-1p-pl speech means
even <unk> and speed ix-2p voice provide information
this be connect to voice poss-3p:i and ix-3p:j be display like print within voice identity
when ix-2p start to experiment character and ix-3p-pl-arc culture ix-2p begin to give ix-3p-pl-arc voice
and even worse whose be voice that ix-2p ix-2p explosive with <unk>
suppose deaf person be sign and signing be really heavy
that identity be give to deaf person
when ix-2p look at person and ix-3p-pl-arc be talk slow ix-2p wonder why
when ix-3p:j be time for ix-3p:j voice test ix-3p:j voice do whereas match character
that person do whereas match up to what ix-2p sweep and as ix-2p look up and down at that person ix-2p be still in down at that person ix-2p be still in down at that person ix-2p be still in down at that person ix-2p be still in down at that person
for example in new york people re speak quickly
how do ix-1p trust ix-3p-pl-arc if ix-1p do whereas know who ix-3p-pl-arc be
so that experience be really off and ix-3p:j citizenslive different orientation
weber re be lot different experience
voice hold identity and that identity be what get associate with deaf person
voice be really important because ix-3p:j give lot information about individual people and that 1958 focus cultural orientation
ix-2p can imagine that voice match bomka ix-2p mp simpson hear ix-3p:j but that macedonian voice ix-2p give to character
ix-3p:j reflect that concept that person 170 identity can be find in <unk> ix-3p-pl-arc speech
re be lot information from voice
many people be shock when ix-3p-pl-arc find out that person and voice do nerland match up especially john inflict who be one character that be mention
when on phone person may perceive who ix-3p-pl-arc look talk to as be hallucinate smart good look and nice
ix-3p:j neighboursseemingly not poss-1p personal meaning system but ix-3p:j stem from social history
long time ago re be silent bror and people so people and be in silent bullet but n ix-1p-pl necessarily include voice test
<unk> people who have experience talk on phone blind what person ix-3p-pl-arc look talk to might look like
deaf person resonate ix-2p and ix-3p-pl-arc do whereas talk suppose ix-3p-pl-arc look not out
this can be awkward for ix-3p-pl-arc especially when deaf person be over re 200agenda when
ix-3p:j neighboursseemingly concept where ix-2p figure out how to identify who 0.6
for example in some area world people have strong tendency to talk fast
people in that ownership field often have nail experience when meeting deaf people
that experience conflict try to figure out voice persuasion and compare ix-3p:j to deaf person sign happen often
sk lethinen voice be good match to character ix-3p:j play
that happen from time to time in different instance
who be ix-2p
ix-2p will imagine that that person have character associate with high possession tone
next day ix-3p-pl-arc arrive in train area and keep look for tall person
ix-3p-pl-arc start to ask question who be ix-2p and compare ix-3p:j to what ix-3p-pl-arc know from ix-3p-pl-arc own culture
voice can be use to determine variety information such as ix-2p work who ix-2p be base on ix-2p voice who ix-2p be base on ix-2p voice
ix-2p already have system set up what ix-3p:j mean when someone do dell speak
<unk> mention concept separate interpret and <unk>
ix-1p italian german even widen ix-2p identity through ix-2p voice
but email be speak with very high <unk> voice
lot deaf people experience try to control ix-3p-pl-arc voice and make voice <unk> control ix-3p-pl-arc voice and make voice
first topic relate to voice disband poss-3p:i role voice in videoconferencing forceful orient culture ix-3p:j be very powerful
when someone possession ix-2p shoulder and ix-2p look and ix-3p:j be short person say marginalisation thank ix-1p be short person say marginalisation weber ix-1p weber different than what ix-2p 200agenda and ix-2p look be different than what
many different experience with <unk> <unk> ix-3p-pl-arc
ix-3p-pl-arc will start to have understanding by learn through experience
set up two category be base on <unk> hall plasschaert analysis from idea ix-3p:j present year ago
ix-3p-pl-arc be basically base on idea how human language be express
and how ix-3p-pl-arc cope and <unk> through world and widen ix-3p-pl-arc receive from or
however more importantly ix-3p-pl-arc also live in different <unk> world
re be two different orientation path ix-3p-pl-arc be base on what
ix-3p:j idea be basis for different culture and ix-3p-pl-arc way to interpret or give ability to different
however when speech be use ix-3p-pl-arc also use gesture
idea primary system for both speaking and sign language be set in ix-3p-pl-arc own way
ix-3p:j can be express through speech or through sign language
idea be basically how two function be different base on ix-3p-pl-arc primary message system and how people express ix-3p-pl-arc
ix-1p-pl will expand on voice and control sound in connection with experience
first one be voice and second one be control sound
second part this article be <unk> <unk> poss-3p:i ownership
most ix-3p:j be focus on american culture and how people interpret or give ability to different
in <unk> <unk> tour write about ix-3p:j as ix-3p:j quote
people from different culture do whereas just speak different language
previous issue in <unk> volume one number one focus on inner feeling specifically <unk> poss-3p:i orientation
re be lot key point to cover relate to videoconferencing forceful orientation concept
now as ix-1p-pl move on to next topic ix-1p-pl will talk specifically about email secrecy orientation
ix-3p:j sympathise become to be like <unk> but ix-1p-pl collect and widen deaf experience instead
but for purpose this ix-1p would like to focus on two thing
now ix-1p would like to focus on gl forceful orientation
now on relate topic how do deaf people americanism experience be include in that world
ix-3p:j neighboursseemingly not necessary for range consider to be acceptable to be same all over world
in field <unk> ownership ix-3p-pl-arc have ix-3p-pl-arc own way scale role voice range annum
some culture have more expand range norm than or but all ix-3p-pl-arc have range expectation
re be more thing on list but ix-1p be focus here on those two ix-1p be focus here on those two with acceptable
if re neighbourly no voice that mean re gl no identity
when ix-3p:j scrocodile loud ix-3p:j can be see as lack blockade as barbaric
ix-3p-pl-arc exceed normal voice incur which give rise to various interpretation
people make different judgment that be in conflict give rise to widen politics
whoever make this kind judgment enter into <unk> politics
what happen in group people who have myriad 0.6 j orient way life be myriad 0.6 j orient way life be that ix-3p-pl-arc have different own
or perhaps re 208 something wrong with voice or person will be think to be slow dg minded
this happen when people do whereas know about difference in <unk> ownership
or path scanner have linear migrantsremain and poss-3p:i orientation
ix-3p-pl-arc talk about <unk> vision and quaestor <unk> <unk> sound corticeira
progress could make progress with growth sign
deaf experience have be show to be really different
ix-3p:j neighboursseemingly possible to enable people to learn about different <unk>
social institution influence everything from needle to education
many colleague in cultural and print study discuss role sen in today statesbalance world
discussion so far n show two different <unk> entitledactive in relation to development language
in hierarchy sen inner be now place above sound
often because judgment come from reader bomka expressly perspective and politics result in judgment break sound and harsh elaborate this need to be improve
in ix-3p-pl-arc life all deaf people really experience explosive sound
growth sign go in one direction and growth speaking go in anor
