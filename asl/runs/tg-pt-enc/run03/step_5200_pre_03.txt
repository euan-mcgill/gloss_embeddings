deaf person be signing over re but ix-2p be also hear voice assistant over here
sound ix-3p-pl-arc voice help ix-2p to make connection to who ix-3p-pl-arc be but now
re be real implication behind value speech culture and what ix-3p:j means when ix-3p:j scrutinise give voice when ix-3p:j
ix-3p:j jacek like <unk> when ix-3p-pl-arc transfer ix-3p-pl-arc voice to <unk>
voice can tell ix-2p if person be intelligent wher or not ix-3p-pl-arc go to college and wher or not ix-3p-pl-arc go to college and wher or not ix-3p-pl-arc go to college
so when ix-2p meeting deaf person and have experience where ix-2p encounter ix-3p-pl-arc and ix-3p-pl-arc do transpose
o whose voice ix-3p:j be when sound be come from different direction
if ix-2p speak fast ix-3p:j mean that ix-2p need smart <unk> smooth and have sharp mind
and meantime over here and ix-3p-pl-arc feel experience duplicate who be speak
<unk> information from voice that tell ix-3p-pl-arc character ix-3p-pl-arc miracle and ix-3p-pl-arc job
people who watch silent incident la canada hear ix-3p:j but can imagine strong heavy <unk> voice from that <unk> character heavy <unk>
ix-1p-pl have ix-1p-pl own idea what ix-1p-pl speech means
even <unk> and speed ix-2p voice provide information
this be connect to voice poss-3p:i and ix-3p:j be translate like print within voice identity
when ix-2p start to inspire character and ix-3p-pl-arc culture ix-2p begin to give ix-3p-pl-arc voice
and even worse whose be voice that ix-2p need <unk> with <unk>
suppose deaf person be signing and sign be really heavy
that identity be give to deaf person
when ix-2p look at person and ix-3p-pl-arc be talk slow ix-2p wonder why
when ix-3p:j be time for ix-3p:j voice test ix-3p:j voice do islam match ix-3p-pl-arc use to be and ix-3p:j career <unk>
that person do canada match up to what ix-2p <unk> and as ix-2p look up and down at that person ix-2p be still in <unk>
for example in new john people re speak quickly
how do ix-1p trust ix-3p-pl-arc if ix-1p do canada know who ix-3p-pl-arc be
so that experience be really off and ix-3p:j publicise different orientation
ok re be lot different experience
voice hold identity and that identity be what get associate with deaf person
voice be really important because ix-3p:j give lot information about ix-3p-pl-arc people and that 1990 focus cultural orientation
ix-2p can imagine that voice match 123 ix-2p la canada hear ix-3p:j but that ecofin voice ix-2p give to character
ix-3p:j reflect that concept that person director identity can be find in <unk> ix-3p-pl-arc speech
re be lot information from voice
many people be shock when ix-3p-pl-arc find out that person and voice do islam match up especially john <unk> be one character that be mention
when on phone person may perceive who ix-3p-pl-arc want talk to as be grotesque smart good look
ix-3p:j jacek not poss-1p personal meaning system but ix-3p:j stem from social history
long time ago re be silent eat
<unk> people who have experience talk on board inspire what person ix-3p-pl-arc look talk to might look like
deaf person <unk> ix-2p and ix-3p-pl-arc do canada talk suppose ix-3p-pl-arc need <unk> and ix-2p need try to figure ix-3p-pl-arc out
this can be fresh for ix-3p-pl-arc especially when deaf person be over re figel
ix-3p:j jacek concept where ix-2p figure out how to identify who 1.7 figure
for example in some area world people have strong tendency to talk fast
people in that orientation field often have silly experience when meeting deaf people
that experience conflict try to figure out voice instruction and compare ix-3p:j to deaf person notice happen often
john figel voice be good match to character ix-3p:j play be that <unk>
that happen from time to time in different instance
who be ix-2p
ix-2p will imagine that that person have character associate with high <unk> tone
next day ix-3p-pl-arc arrive in train area and keep look for tree person
ix-3p-pl-arc start to ask question who be ix-2p and compare ix-3p:j to what ix-3p-pl-arc know from ix-3p-pl-arc own culture
voice can be use to determine variety information such as ix-2p work people already know ix-2p identity and can judge
ix-2p already have system set up what ix-3p:j mean when someone do canada speak
<unk> mention concept smaller interpret and <unk>
ix-1p austrian canada even <unk> ix-2p identity through ix-2p voice
but meantime be speak with very high <unk> voice
lot deaf people experience try to control ix-3p-pl-arc voice and secular ix-3p-pl-arc voice
first topic relate to voice <unk> role voice in videoconferencing anxiety orient culture ix-3p:j be very powerful
when someone 120 ix-2p shoulder and ix-2p look and ix-3p:j be short person say flat like ix-1p think meeting be different than what ix-2p meeting 1.7 1993 and ix-2p need surprise
many different experience with <unk> <unk> ix-3p-pl-arc
ix-3p-pl-arc will start to have understanding by learn through experience
set up two category be base on <unk> mail ayalum analysis from idea ix-3p:j development year ago
ix-3p-pl-arc be basically base on idea how human language be express
and how ix-3p-pl-arc cope and <unk> through world and <unk> ix-3p-pl-arc receive from or
however more importantly ix-3p-pl-arc also live in different <unk> world
re be two different orientation path ix-3p-pl-arc be base on what
ix-3p:j idea be basis for different culture and ix-3p-pl-arc way to interpret or give clearly to different <unk> experience
but when speech be use ix-3p-pl-arc also use gesture
idea primary system for both speak and sign language be set in ix-3p-pl-arc own way
ix-3p:j can be express through speech or through sign language
idea be basically how two vision be different base on ix-3p-pl-arc primary message system and how people express ix-3p-pl-arc
ix-1p-pl will expand on voice and control sound in connection with experience
first one be voice and second one be control sound
second part this article be <unk> <unk> orientation
most ix-3p:j be focus on american culture and how people interpret or give meaning to different <unk> and voice
in <unk> <unk> director write about ix-3p:j as ix-3p:j quote
people from different culture do logically just speak different language
previous issue in academic testing one number one focus on societal feeling specifically <unk> orientation
re be lot key point to cover relate to videoconferencing anxiety format concept
now as ix-1p-pl move on to next topic ix-1p-pl will talk specifically about assistant anxiety
ix-3p:j be become to be like <unk> but ix-1p-pl collect and <unk> deaf experience instead
but for purpose this ix-1p would like to focus on two thing
now ix-1p would like to focus on truck anxiety alignment
now on relate topic how do deaf people penalize experience be include in that world
ix-3p:j jacek not necessary for fewer consider to be acceptable to be same all over world
in field <unk> orientation ix-3p-pl-arc have ix-3p-pl-arc own way <unk> role voice range
some culture have more expand range norm than or but all ix-3p-pl-arc have range expectation
re be more thing on list but ix-1p be focus here on those two with respect smaller
if re rationalise no voice that means re 31 no identity
when ix-3p:j rationalise sad ix-3p:j can be see as lack <unk> as barbaric
ix-3p-pl-arc exceed normal voice increase which give rise to various context
people make different judgment that be in conflict give rise to <unk> politics
whoever make this kind judgment enter into <unk> politics
what happen in group people who have print cheque <unk> orient but ix-3p-pl-arc break many group range rule when ix-3p-pl-arc join different group
or perhaps re vilnius something wrong with voice or person will be think to be slow fritter love
this happen when people do canada know about difference in <unk> orientation
that first <unk> have forth yugoslavium poss-3p:i orientation
ix-3p-pl-arc talk about <unk> vision and pound <unk> <unk> sound 74
deaf people make progress with growth signing
deaf experience have be show to be really different
ix-3p:j jacek possible to enable people to learn about different <unk>
social institution influence everything from drug to education
many colleague in cultural and skopje study discuss role sen in today eyeprocedure world
discussion so far n show two different <unk> merkel in relation to development language
in hierarchy magic videoconferencing be now place above sound
often because judgment come from assistant 192 oral perspective <unk> politics result in judgment break sound and harsh <unk> this need break
in ix-3p-pl-arc life all deaf people really experience <unk> sound
growth sign go in one direction broadcaster growth speaking go in anor
