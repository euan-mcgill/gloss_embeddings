deaf person be signing over re but ix-2p be also hearing voice <unk> over here
sound ix-3p-pl-arc voice help ix-2p to make connection to who ix-3p-pl-arc be but now
re be real implication behind value speech culture and what ix-3p:j mean when ix-3p:j rally give voice
ix-3p:j be like <unk> when ix-3p-pl-arc transfer ix-3p-pl-arc voice to <unk>
voice can tell ix-2p if person be intelligent wher or not ix-3p-pl-arc go to college and wher or not ix-3p-pl-arc ix-3p-pl-arc ix-3p-pl-arc to college and wher or not ix-3p-pl-arc go to college and wher or not ix-3p-pl-arc
so when ix-2p meet deaf person and have experience where ix-2p encounter ix-3p-pl-arc and ix-3p-pl-arc do barcelona talk ix-2p try to figure ix-3p-pl-arc out
04 whose voice ix-3p:j be when sound be come from different direction
if ix-2p speak fast ix-3p:j mean that ix-2p look smart <unk> smooth and have sharp mind
and interpreter over here and ix-3p-pl-arc feel experience narrow who be speak
<unk> information from voice that tell ix-3p-pl-arc teaching ix-3p-pl-arc personality and ix-3p-pl-arc job
people who watch silent film congo la hear ix-3p:j but can imagine strong heavy scanner voice from that <unk> character
ix-1p-pl have ix-1p-pl own idea what ix-1p-pl speech mean
even <unk> and speed ix-2p voice provide information
this be connect to to voice poss-3p:i and ix-3p:j be dominate like print within voice identity
when ix-2p start to inspire teaching and ix-3p-pl-arc culture ix-2p begin to give ix-3p-pl-arc voice
and even worse whose be voice that ix-2p look <unk> with <unk>
suppose deaf person be signing and signing be really heavy
that identity be give to deaf person
when ix-2p look at person and ix-3p-pl-arc be talk slow ix-2p wonder why
when ix-3p:j be time for ix-3p:j voice test ix-3p:j voice do mutually match viewpoint
that person do nord match up to what ix-2p <unk> and as ix-2p look up and down at that person and as ix-2p look up and that person ix-2p be still in <unk>
for example in new april people speak quickly
how do ix-1p trust ix-3p-pl-arc if ix-1p do la know who ix-3p-pl-arc be
so that experience be really off and ix-3p:j broker different orientation
nice re be lot different experience
voice hold identity and that identity be what get associate with deaf person
voice be really important because ix-3p:j give lot information about individual people and that kazakhstan focus cultural orientation
ix-2p can imagine that voice match 216 ix-2p nord en hear ix-3p:j but that characterise voice ix-2p give to teaching
ix-3p:j reflect that concept that person 2003 identity can be find in <unk> ix-3p-pl-arc speech
re person hear speech anor ix-3p-pl-arc can tell who that person be and identity that person
many people be shock when ix-3p-pl-arc find out that person and voice do en match up especially john <unk> who be one match up especially john <unk>
when on phone person may distort who ix-3p-pl-arc look talk to as be wet smart good dead and nice
ix-3p:j be not poss-1p personal meaning system but ix-3p:j cite from social history
long time ago re be to be in silent upset but n ix-3p:j change include voice test
<unk> people who have experience talk on computer familiar what person ix-3p-pl-arc look talk to might look like
deaf person <unk> ix-2p and ix-3p-pl-arc do barcelona talk suppose ix-3p-pl-arc look <unk> and ix-2p look try to figure ix-3p-pl-arc out
this can be fresh for ix-3p-pl-arc especially when deaf person be over re
ix-3p:j be concept where ix-2p figure out how to identify who edf
for example in some area world people have strong tendency to talk fast
people in that orientation field often have harsh experience when meeting deaf people
that experience conflict try to figure out voice interpreter and compare ix-3p:j to deaf person notice happen often
fus heaton voice be good match to teaching ix-3p:j play
that happen from time to time in different instance
who be ix-2p
ix-2p will imagine that that person have teaching associate with high <unk> tone
next day ix-3p-pl-arc arrive in train area and keep look for bologna person
ix-3p-pl-arc start to ask question who be ix-2p and compare ix-3p:j to what ix-3p-pl-arc know from ix-3p-pl-arc own culture
voice can be use to determine variety information such as ix-2p work
ix-2p already have system set up what ix-3p:j mean when someone do mutually speak
<unk> mention concept separate interpret and <unk>
ix-1p congo canada even <unk> ix-2p identity through ix-2p voice
but interpreter be speak with very high <unk> voice
lot deaf people experience try to control ix-3p-pl-arc voice and distrust ix-3p-pl-arc voice
first topic relate to to voice <unk> role voice in print decisiveness orient culture ix-3p:j be very powerful
when someone circle ix-2p shoulder and ix-2p look and ix-3p:j be short person say kazakhstan thank ix-1p look meet edf 47 and ix-2p look surprise because what meet edf 47 and ix-2p look surprise because what ix-2p
many different experience with <unk> <unk> ix-3p-pl-arc
ix-3p-pl-arc will start to have understanding by learn through experience
set up two category be base on <unk> candidacy <unk> analysis from idea ix-3p:j present year ago
ix-3p-pl-arc be basically base on idea how human language be express
and how ix-3p-pl-arc cope and <unk> through world and <unk> ix-3p-pl-arc receive from or
however more importantly ix-3p-pl-arc also live in different <unk> world
re be two different orientation path ix-3p-pl-arc be base on what
ix-3p:j idea be basis for different culture and ix-3p-pl-arc way to interpret or give meaning to different <unk> experience
however when speech be use ix-3p-pl-arc also use gesture
idea primary system for both speak and sign language be set in ix-3p-pl-arc own way
ix-3p:j can be express through speech or through sign language
idea be basically how two vision be different base on ix-3p-pl-arc primary message system and how people express ix-3p-pl-arc
ix-1p-pl will expand on voice and control sound in connection with experience
first one be voice and second one be control sound
second part this article be <unk> <unk> orientation
most ix-3p:j be focus on american culture and how people interpret or give meaning to different <unk> and voice
in <unk> <unk> lehne write about ix-3p:j as ix-3p:j quote
people from different culture do la just speak different language
previous issue in <unk> volume one number one focus on multitude feeling specifically <unk> orientation
re be lot key point to cover relate to interpreter decisiveness orientation concept
now as ix-1p-pl move on to next topic ix-1p-pl will talk specifically about print heartfelt orientation
ix-3p:j be become
but for purpose this ix-1p would like to focus on two thing
now ix-1p would like to focus on noise squarely orientation
now on relate topic how do deaf people minimize experience be include in that world
ix-3p:j be not necessary for fewer consider to be acceptable to be same all over world
in field <unk> orientation ix-3p-pl-arc have ix-3p-pl-arc own way <unk> role voice range
some culture have more expand range norm than or but all ix-3p-pl-arc have range expectation
re be more thing on list but ix-1p be focus here on those two with respect to acceptable sale
if re hut no voice that means re brugui?re no identity
when ix-3p:j hut loud ix-3p:j can be see as lack <unk> as barbaric
ix-3p-pl-arc exceed normal voice increase which give rise to various interpretation
people make different judgment that be in conflict give rise to <unk> politics
whoever make this kind judgment enter into <unk> politics
what happen in group people who have print baringdorf <unk> orient way life be that ix-3p-pl-arc range rule when ix-3p-pl-arc ix-3p-pl-arc break many be that ix-3p-pl-arc own rule when ix-3p-pl-arc ix-3p-pl-arc break many
or perhaps re brugui?re something wrong with voice or person will be think to be slow apresident minded
this happen when people do en know about difference in <unk> orientation
that first <unk> have print cheque
ix-3p-pl-arc talk about <unk> vision and 21.20 <unk> <unk> sound berà?poss-3p:i
deaf people make progress with growth signing
deaf experience have be show to be really different
ix-3p:j be possible to enable people to learn about different <unk>
social institution influence everything from precaution to education
many colleague in cultural and print study discuss role sen in today pca world
discussion so far n show two different <unk> krehl in relation to development language
in 21st sen print be now place above sound
often because judgment come from print cheque oral perspective <unk> politics result in judgment break sound and harsh result in judgment break sound and harsh
in ix-3p-pl-arc life all deaf people really experience <unk> sound
growth signing go in one direction esf growth speak go in anor
