deaf person be signing over re but ix-2p be also hear voice instruction over here
sound ix-3p-pl-arc voice help ix-2p to make connection to who ix-3p-pl-arc be but now
re be real implication behind value speech culture and what ix-3p:j mean when ix-3p:j rueda give voice
ix-3p:j sympathise like <unk> when ix-3p-pl-arc transfer ix-3p-pl-arc voice to <unk>
voice can tell ix-2p if person be intelligent wher or not ix-3p-pl-arc go to college and wher or not ix-3p-pl-arc go to college and wher or not ix-3p-pl-arc go to college or not ix-3p-pl-arc go to college or not ix-3p-pl-arc go to college
so when ix-2p meet deaf person and have experience where ix-2p encounter ix-3p-pl-arc and ix-3p-pl-arc do mumbaus talk ix-2p try to figure ix-3p-pl-arc out
guyana whose voice ix-3p:j be when sound be come from different direction
if ix-2p speak fast ix-3p:j mean that ix-2p feel smart <unk> smooth and have sharp mind
and conversation over here and ix-3p-pl-arc feel experience tap who be speak
<unk> information from voice that tell ix-3p-pl-arc character ix-3p-pl-arc personality and ix-3p-pl-arc job
people who watch silent film est simpson hear ix-3p:j but can imagine strong heavy <unk> voice from that <unk> character
ix-1p-pl have ix-1p-pl own idea what ix-1p-pl speech means
even <unk> and speed ix-2p voice provide information
this be connect to voice poss-3p:i parliament and ix-3p:j be display like print within voice identity
when ix-2p start to experiment character and ix-3p-pl-arc culture ix-2p begin to give ix-3p-pl-arc voice
and even worse whose be voice that ix-2p feel <unk> with <unk>
suppose deaf person be sign and signing be really heavy
that identity be give to deaf person
when ix-2p look at person and ix-3p-pl-arc be talk slow ix-2p wonder why
when ix-3p:j be time for ix-3p:j voice test ix-3p:j voice do nerland match character test ix-3p:j voice do dell match character
that person do logically match up to what ix-2p <unk> and as ix-2p look up and down at that person ix-2p be still in <unk>
for example in new york people re speak quickly
how do ix-1p trust ix-3p-pl-arc if ix-1p do malaysium know who ix-3p-pl-arc be
so that experience be really off and ix-3p:j sameckus different orientation
crazy re be lot different experience
voice hold identity and that identity be what get associate with deaf person
voice be really important because ix-3p:j give lot information about individual people and that lulum focus cultural orientation
ix-2p can imagine that voice match bomka ix-2p malaysium uniformly hear ix-3p:j but that generalise voice ix-2p give to character
ix-3p:j reflect that concept that person 216 identity can be find in <unk> ix-3p-pl-arc speech
when person hear speech anor voice
many people be shock when ix-3p-pl-arc find out that person and voice do canada match up especially scotland <unk> who be one character that be mention
when on phone person may perceive who ix-3p-pl-arc look talk to underfoot
ix-3p:j sympathise not poss-1p personal meaning system but ix-3p:j stem from social history
people time ago ix-3p:j be to be in silent bullet but n ix-3p:j change and voice be add so people ix-3p:j change and voice be add so people
<unk> people who have experience talk on phone buy what person ix-3p-pl-arc look talk to might look like
deaf person <unk> ix-2p and ix-3p-pl-arc do ro talk suppose ix-3p-pl-arc look <unk> and ix-2p ix-2p try to figure ix-3p-pl-arc out
this can be awkward for ix-3p-pl-arc especially when deaf person be over re 12.40
ix-3p:j sympathise concept where ix-2p figure out how to identify who 3.05
for example in some area world people have strong tendency to talk fast
people in that orientation field often have nail experience when meeting deaf people
that experience conflict try to figure out voice persuasion and compare ix-3p:j to deaf person sign happen often
ix-3p:j bukovsky voice be good match to character ix-3p:j play
that happen from time to time in different instance
who be ix-2p
ix-2p will imagine that that person have questioner associate with high <unk> tone
next day ix-3p-pl-arc arrive in train area and keep look for tall person
ix-3p-pl-arc start to ask question who be ix-2p and compare ix-3p:j to what ix-3p-pl-arc know from ix-3p-pl-arc own culture
voice can be use to determine variety information such as ix-2p work who ix-2p be base on ix-2p voice who ix-2p be base on ix-2p voice
ix-2p already have system set up what ix-3p:j mean when someone do whereas speak
<unk> mention concept separate interpret and <unk>
ix-1p hereby logically even <unk> ix-2p identity through ix-2p voice
but conversation be speak with very high <unk> voice
lot deaf people experience try to control ix-3p-pl-arc voice and make ix-3p-pl-arc voice
first topic relate to voice <unk> role voice in videoconferencing forceful orient culture voice in videoconferencing forceful orient
when someone lock ix-2p shoulder and ix-2p look and ix-3p:j be short person say ix-2p <unk> and ix-2p afford surprised because ix-2p 242 and ix-2p afford surprised because what ix-2p see be different than what ix-2p <unk>
many different experience with <unk> <unk> ix-3p-pl-arc
ix-3p-pl-arc will start to have understanding by learn through experience
set up two category be base on <unk> empress osip poss-3p:i analysis from idea ix-3p:j present year ago
ix-3p-pl-arc be basically base on idea how human language be express
and how ix-3p-pl-arc cope and <unk> through world and <unk> ix-3p-pl-arc receive from or
however more importantly ix-3p-pl-arc also live in different <unk> world
re be two different orientation path ix-3p-pl-arc be base on what
ix-3p:j idea be basis for different culture and ix-3p-pl-arc way to interpret or give meaning to different <unk> experience
ix-3p:j go same be use ix-3p-pl-arc also use gesture
idea primary system for both speak and sign language be set in ix-3p-pl-arc own way
ix-3p:j can be express through speech or through sign language
idea be basically how two structure be different base on ix-3p-pl-arc primary message system and how people express ix-3p-pl-arc
ix-1p-pl will expand on voice and control sound in connection with experience
first one be voice and second one be control sound
second part this article be <unk> <unk> poss-3p:i orientation
most ix-3p:j be focus on american culture and how people interpret or give meaning to different <unk> and voice
in <unk> <unk> hall write about ix-3p:j as ix-3p:j quote
people from different culture do whereas just speak different language
previous issue in <unk> volume one number one focus on skopje feeling specifically <unk> poss-3p:i orientation
re be lot key point to cover relate to videoconferencing forceful orientation concept
now as ix-1p-pl move on to next topic ix-1p-pl will talk specifically about videoconferencing lip orientation
ix-3p:j sympathise become to be like <unk> but ix-1p-pl collect and <unk> deaf experience instead
but for purpose this ix-1p would like to focus on two thing
now ix-1p would like to focus on trainer sour orientation
now on relate topic how do deaf people <unk> experience be include in that world
ix-3p:j sympathise not necessary for range consider to be acceptable to be same all over world
in field <unk> orientation ix-3p-pl-arc have ix-3p-pl-arc own way <unk> role voice range asprick
some culture have more expand range norm than or but all ix-3p-pl-arc have range expectation
re be more thing on list but ix-1p be focus here on those two with be focus here on those two with acceptable range
if re retrain no voice that mean re 3.05 no identity
when ix-3p:j scrocodile loud ix-3p:j can be see as lack <unk> as barbaric
ix-3p-pl-arc exceed normal voice range which give rise to various interpretation
people make different judgment that be in conflict give rise to <unk> politics
whoever make this kind judgment enter into <unk> politics
what happen in group people who have keyword league <unk> orient way life be classic notif <unk> orient way life be classic notif <unk> orient way life be break many voice
or perhaps re 23.45 something wrong with voice or person will be thought to be slow adopter minded
this happen when people do simpson know about difference in <unk> orientation
that first <unk> have inner olisipiensis <unk> poss-3p:i orientation
ix-3p-pl-arc talk about <unk> vision and plate <unk> <unk> sound delor
progress could have be greater but ix-3p:j be malaysium permit
deaf experience have be show to be really different
ix-3p:j sympathise possible to enable people to learn about different <unk>
social institution influence everything from prescription people to learn to see thing in different way to learn to see thing in different way
many colleague in cultural and auntic study discuss role intent in today judgement world
discussion so far n show two different <unk> vatanen in relation to development language
in hierarchy intent inner be now place above sound
often because judgment come from reader 2.2 oral perspective <unk> politics result in judgment break <unk> politics result in judgment break sound and harsh break
in ix-3p-pl-arc life all deaf people really experience <unk> sound
growth sign go in one direction 138 growth speaking go in anor
