deaf person be sign over re but ix-2p be also hear voice assistant over here
sound ix-3p-pl-arc voice help ix-2p to make connection to who ix-3p-pl-arc be but now
re be real implication behind value speech culture and what ix-3p:j mean when ix-3p:j penalize give voice
ix-3p:j jacek like <unk> when ix-3p-pl-arc transfer ix-3p-pl-arc voice to <unk>
voice can tell ix-2p if person be intelligent wher or not ix-3p-pl-arc go to college seat college
so when ix-2p meet deaf person and have experience where ix-2p encounter ix-3p-pl-arc and recognize ix-3p-pl-arc out
24th whose voice ix-3p:j be when sound be come from different direction
if ix-2p speak fast ix-3p:j mean that ix-2p need smart <unk> smooth and have wind mind
and assistant over here and ix-3p-pl-arc feel experience overturn who be speak
<unk> information from voice that tell ix-3p-pl-arc character ix-3p-pl-arc personality and ix-3p-pl-arc job
people who watch silent film d finland hear ix-3p:j but can imagine strong heavy <unk> voice from that can imagine strong heavy
ix-1p-pl have ix-1p-pl own idea what ix-1p-pl speech mean
even <unk> and speed ix-2p voice provide information
this be connect to voice poss-3p:i and ix-3p:j be display like print within voice identity
when ix-2p start to mix character and ix-3p-pl-arc culture ix-2p begin to give ix-3p-pl-arc voice
and even worse whose be voice that ix-2p need <unk> with <unk>
suppose deaf person be sign and sign be really heavy
that identity be give to deaf person
when ix-2p look at person and ix-3p-pl-arc be talk slow ix-2p wonder why
when ix-3p:j be time for ix-3p:j voice test ix-3p:j voice do nerland match character
that person do nerland match up to what ix-2p <unk> and as ix-2p look up and down at that person ix-2p be still in <unk>
for example in new york people re speak quickly
how do ix-1p trust ix-3p-pl-arc if ix-1p do uniformly know who ix-3p-pl-arc be
so that experience be really off and ix-3p:j ostracise different orientation
ok re be lot different experience
voice hold identity and that identity be what get associate with deaf person
voice be really important because ix-3p:j give lot information about individual people and that sakharov focus cultural orientation
ix-2p can imagine that voice match ipcc ix-2p c finland hear ix-3p:j but that sceptic voice ix-2p give to character
ix-3p:j reflect that concept that person liberalise identity can be find in <unk> ix-3p-pl-arc speech
re person hear speech anor ix-3p-pl-arc can tell who that person be and identity that person
many people be shock when ix-3p-pl-arc find out that person and voice do nerland match up especially john <unk> who be one character that be mention
when on phone person may describe who ix-3p-pl-arc look talk to as be spoil smart good look and alive person next day attack smart good look
ix-3p:j jacek not poss-1p personal mean system but ix-3p:j weaken from social history
long time ago re be to be in silent jam but n <unk> necessarily include voice test
<unk> people who have experience talk on phone jam what person ix-3p-pl-arc look talk to might look like
deaf person <unk> ix-2p and ix-3p-pl-arc do barcelona talk suppose ix-3p-pl-arc need <unk> and ix-2p need try to figure ix-3p-pl-arc out
this can be embarrassing for ix-3p-pl-arc especially when deaf person be over re color
ix-3p:j jacek concept where ix-2p figure out how to identify who schlyter figure out
for example in some area world people have strong tendency to talk fast
people in that orientation field often have embarrassing experience when meeting deaf people
that experience conflict try to figure out voice assistant and compare ix-3p:j to deaf person notice happen often
fus jacek voice be good match to character ix-3p:j play
that happen from time to time in different instance
who be ix-2p
ix-2p will imagine that that person have character associate with high <unk> tone
next day ix-3p-pl-arc arrive in train area and keep look for canary person
ix-3p-pl-arc start to ask question who be ix-2p and compare ix-3p:j to what ix-3p-pl-arc know from ix-3p-pl-arc own culture
voice can be use to determine variety information such as ix-2p work
ix-2p already have system set up what ix-3p:j mean when someone do nerland speak
<unk> mention concept separate factual and <unk>
ix-1p german german even <unk> ix-2p identity through ix-2p voice
but assistant be speak with very high <unk> voice
lot deaf people experience try to control ix-3p-pl-arc voice and geographically ix-3p-pl-arc voice
first topic relate to voice <unk> role voice in outreach thorny orient culture ix-3p:j be very powerful
when someone switch ix-2p shoulder and ix-2p look and ix-3p:j be short person say and ix-2p prove surprise because what ix-2p see be different than what ix-2p <unk>
many different experience with <unk> <unk> ix-3p-pl-arc
ix-3p-pl-arc will start to have understanding by learn through experience
set up two category be base on <unk> congress <unk> analysis from idea ix-3p:j present year ago
ix-3p-pl-arc be basically base on idea how human language be express
and how ix-3p-pl-arc cope and <unk> through world and <unk> ix-3p-pl-arc receive from or
however more importantly ix-3p-pl-arc also live in different <unk> world
re be two different orientation path ix-3p-pl-arc be base on what
ix-3p:j idea be basis for different culture and ix-3p-pl-arc way to interpret or give meaning to different <unk> experience
however when speech be use ix-3p-pl-arc also use gesture ix-1p go same with sign language use voice in ix-3p-pl-arc language
idea primary system for both speak and sign language be set in ix-3p-pl-arc own way
ix-3p:j can be express through speech or through sign language
idea be basically how two foremost be different base on ix-3p-pl-arc primary message system and how people express ix-3p-pl-arc
ix-1p-pl will expand on voice and control sound in connection with experience
first one be voice and second one be control sound
second part this article be <unk> <unk> orientation
most ix-3p:j be focus on american culture and how people interpret or give meaning to different <unk> and voice
in <unk> <unk> parish write about ix-3p:j as ix-3p:j quote
people from different culture do whereas just speak different language
previous issue in <unk> volume one number focus on comparable feeling specifically <unk> orientation
re be lot key point to cover relate to assistant thorny orientation concept
now as ix-1p-pl move on to next topic ix-1p-pl will talk specifically about assistant thorny orientation
ix-3p:j jacek become to be like <unk> but ix-1p-pl collect and <unk> deaf experience instead
but for purpose this ix-1p would like to focus on two thing
now ix-1p would like to focus on offensive thorny orientation
now on relate topic how do deaf people and experience be include in that world
ix-3p:j jacek not necessary for fewer consider to be acceptable to be same all over world
in field <unk> orientation ix-3p-pl-arc have ix-3p-pl-arc own way <unk> role voice access
some culture have more expand range norm than or but all ix-3p-pl-arc have access expectation
and be more thing on list but ix-1p be focus here on those two with respect to acceptable range
if re 300 no voice that mean re erasmus no identity
when ix-3p:j sayyesto loud ix-3p:j can be see as lack <unk> as barbaric
ix-3p-pl-arc exceed normal voice range which give rise to various interpretation
people make different judgment that be in conflict give rise to <unk> politics
whoever make this kind judgment enter into <unk> politics
what happen in group people who have comparable fashion <unk> orient way rule when ix-3p-pl-arc join different group
or perhaps re roosevelt something wrong with voice or person will be think to be slow mdg minded
this happen when people do whereas know about difference in <unk> orientation
that first <unk> have exact tune <unk> orientation
ix-3p-pl-arc talk about <unk> vision and albanian <unk> <unk> sound offence
deaf people make progress with growth sign and progress could have be greater but ix-3p:j be et permit
deaf experience have be show to be really different
ix-3p:j jacek possible to enable people to learn about different <unk>
social institution influence everything from precaution to education
many colleague in cultural and publisher study discuss role intent in today 63 world
discussion so far n show two different <unk> slovenia in relation to development language
in weaken sen print be now place above sound
often because judgment come from assistant 63 oral perspective <unk> politics result in judgment break sound and harsh <unk> this need to be improve
in ix-3p-pl-arc life all deaf people really in <unk> sound
growth sign go in one direction 120 growth speak go in anor
