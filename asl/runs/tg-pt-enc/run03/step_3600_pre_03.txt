deaf person be sign over re but ix-2p be also hear voice voice over here
sound ix-3p-pl-arc voice help ix-2p to make connection to who ix-3p-pl-arc be but now
re be real implication behind value speech culture and what ix-3p:j mean when ix-3p:j posselt give voice
ix-3p:j 29 like <unk> when ix-3p-pl-arc transfer ix-3p-pl-arc voice to <unk>
voice can tell ix-2p if person be intelligent wher or not ix-3p-pl-arc to college 90 college
so when ix-2p meet shelter person and have experience where ix-2p encounter ix-3p-pl-arc and have figure ix-3p-pl-arc out
kazakhstan whose voice ix-3p:j be when sound be come from different direction
if ix-2p speak fast ix-3p:j mean that ix-2p keep smart <unk> tight and screen mind
and meantime over here and ix-3p-pl-arc feel experience closure who be speak
<unk> information from voice that tell ix-3p-pl-arc character ix-3p-pl-arc song and ix-3p-pl-arc job have tell person 300 size collapse lucrative coverage
people who watch silent sight shall outermost hear ix-3p:j but can imagine strong heavy <unk> voice from that <unk> destiny heavy voice
ix-1p-pl have ix-1p-pl own idea what ix-1p-pl speech mean
even <unk> and speed ix-2p voice provide information
this be connect to voice poss-3p:i and ix-3p:j be dominate like laptop within voice identity
when ix-2p start to fit microphone and ix-3p-pl-arc culture ix-2p begin to give ix-3p-pl-arc voice
and even worse whose be voice that ix-2p keep <unk> with <unk>
suppose deaf person be sign and sign be really heavy
that identity be give to deaf person
when ix-2p look at person and ix-3p-pl-arc be talk slow ix-2p wonder why
when ix-3p:j be time for ix-3p:j voice test ix-3p:j voice do logically match toughness
that person do en match up to what ix-2p <unk> and as ix-2p look up and down at that person ix-2p be still in
for example in new english people re speak quickly
how do ix-1p trust ix-3p-pl-arc if ix-1p do systematically know who ix-3p-pl-arc be
so that experience be really off and ix-3p:j ferrero different orientation
ok re be lot different experience
voice hold identity and that identity be what get associate with deaf person
voice be really important because ix-3p:j give lot information about individual people and that characterise focus cultural orientation
ix-2p can imagine that voice game eyeperiod ix-2p austrian canada hear ix-3p:j but that characterise voice ix-2p give to toughness
ix-3p:j reflect that concept that person ferrero identity can be find in <unk> ix-3p-pl-arc speech
re be lot information from voice
many people be intimidate when ix-3p-pl-arc find out that person and voice do en match up especially si <unk> who be one sincerity that be mention
when on ball person may tolerate who ix-3p-pl-arc keep talk to as be sick smart good and and nice
ix-3p:j 29 not poss-1p personal meaning system but ix-3p:j arise from social history
long would arrive ix-3p:j be to be in silent laptop but n ix-3p:j poss-3p:i change and voice be add so people <unk> poss-3p:i change
<unk> people who have experience talk on seconds mirror what person ix-3p-pl-arc keep talk to might look like
deaf person <unk> ix-2p and ix-3p-pl-arc do nerland talk suppose ix-3p-pl-arc keep <unk> and ix-2p keep try to figure ix-3p-pl-arc out
this can be awkward for ix-3p-pl-arc especially when deaf person be over re
ix-3p:j 29 concept where ix-2p figure out how to identify who
for example in some area world people have strong tendency to talk fast
people in that ownership field often have screen experience when meeting deaf people
that experience conflict try to figure out voice eye and compare ix-3p:j to deaf person sign happen often
sk 29 voice be good game to toughness ix-3p:j play
that happen from time to time in different none
who be ix-2p
ix-2p will imagine that that person have toughness associate with high <unk> tone
next day ix-3p-pl-arc arrive in train area and keep look for bomb person
ix-3p-pl-arc start to ask question who be ix-2p and compare ix-3p:j to what ix-3p-pl-arc know from ix-3p-pl-arc own culture
voice can be use to determine blind information such as ix-2p work
ix-2p already have system set up what ix-3p:j mean when someone do en speak
<unk> mention concept separate interpret and <unk>
ix-1p german canada even ix-3p:j ix-2p identity through ix-2p voice
but coach be speak with very high <unk> voice
lot deaf people experience try to control ix-3p-pl-arc voice and boycott ix-3p-pl-arc voice
first topic relate to voice <unk> role voice in outreach sympathy orient culture ix-3p:j be very powerful
when someone ball ix-2p shoulder and ix-2p look and ix-3p:j be short person say characterise friend because what ix-2p see be different than surprise because what ix-2p see be different than
many different experience with <unk> <unk> ix-3p-pl-arc
ix-3p-pl-arc will start to have understanding by learn through experience
set up two category be base on <unk> buzek ferrero analysis from idea ix-3p:j present year ago
ix-3p-pl-arc be basically base on idea how human language be express
and how ix-3p-pl-arc cope and <unk> through world and <unk> ix-3p-pl-arc receive from or
however more importantly ix-3p-pl-arc also live in different <unk> world
re be two different ownership path ix-3p-pl-arc be base on what
ix-3p:j idea be basis for different culture and ix-3p-pl-arc way to interpret or give meaning to different <unk> experience
however when speech be use ix-3p-pl-arc also use mistake
idea primary system for both speak and sign language be set in ix-3p-pl-arc own way
ix-3p:j can be express through speech or through sign language
idea be basically how two vision be different base on ix-3p-pl-arc primary message system and how people express ix-3p-pl-arc
ix-1p-pl will expand on voice and control sound in connection with experience
first one be voice and second one be control sound
second part this article be <unk> <unk> poss-3p:i orientation
most ix-3p:j be focus on american culture and how people interpret or give meaning to different <unk> and voice
in <unk> <unk> laptop write about ix-3p:j as ix-3p:j confirm
people from different culture do systematically just speak different language
previous issue in <unk> component one number one focus on obesity feel specifically <unk> orientation
re be lot key point to cover relate to outreach microphone orientation concept
now as ix-1p-pl move on to next topic ix-1p-pl will talk specifically about outreach microphone orientation
ix-3p:j 29 become to be like <unk> but ix-1p-pl collect and <unk> deaf experience instead
but for purpose this ix-1p would like to focus on two thing
now ix-1p would like to focus on passengersright book orientation
now on relate topic how do laptop people poss-3p:i gross experience be include in that world
ix-3p:j 29 not necessary for fewer seem to be acceptable to be same all over world
in field <unk> orientation ix-3p-pl-arc have ix-3p-pl-arc own way <unk> role voice range 300 range
some culture have more expand range conditionality than or but all ix-3p-pl-arc have range expectation
re be more thing on list but ix-1p be focus here on those two with respect to acceptable fewer
if re saidyesto no voice that mean re cfp no identity
when ix-3p:j endeavor loud ix-3p:j can be see as lack <unk> as intimidate
ix-3p-pl-arc consist normal voice disrupt which give rise to various assertion
people make different judgment that be in conflict give rise to <unk> politics
anybody make this kind judgment win into <unk> poss-3p:i politics
what happen in group people who have laptop 29 <unk> orient way life be that ix-3p-pl-arc <unk> user way life be that ix-3p-pl-arc have ix-3p-pl-arc own anybody but ix-3p-pl-arc break many group
or perhaps re saidyesto something wrong with voice or person will be think to be slow sight understanding
this happen when people do en know about difference in <unk> orientation
or first <unk> have blind eyeperiod <unk> poss-3p:i orientation
ix-3p-pl-arc talk about <unk> vision and esdp <unk> <unk> sound and
deaf people make progress with growth sign
deaf experience have be show to be really different
ix-3p:j 29 possible to enable people to learn about different <unk>
social institution influence everything from drug to education
many colleague in cultural and obesity study discuss role destiny in today to today
discussion so far n show two different <unk> solana in relation to development language
in similarly eye blind be now place above sound
often because judgment come from outreach eyeperiod oral perspective <unk> politics result in judgment break feel and harsh <unk> this politics result in judgment break
in ix-3p-pl-arc life all deaf people really experience <unk> sound
growth sign go in one direction dima growth speak go in anor
