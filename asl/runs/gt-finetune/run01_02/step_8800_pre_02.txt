you decided to leave anything , the college , or the college know , or the college ...
so in la , its of us were deaf , you have been talking to do what to do i did n't know what to do i did n't know what to do . "

i was in the motorcycle 's job . it could be " from the voices .
people were alright , who are stolen , they ca like that . "
we have an emergency with friends to drive .
the hearing person got and got to the ra .
in la , he has been in the hands .
that means that means a culture -- i was driving to the bathroom .

" from his letter , who is deaf .
for example to new york , and started to new york .
how i do n't know , i do n't know .

people were who they use to a story to the story to sign in the stories and a story of the city .
the deaf person said , " really ? "
except when i was deaf .
so , the study of course how people did . ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?
