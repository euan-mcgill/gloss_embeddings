deaf person be sign over re but ix-2p be also hear voice interpreter over here
sound ix-3p-pl-arc voice help ix-2p to make connection to who ix-3p-pl-arc be but now
re be real implication behind value speech culture and what ix-3p:j mean when ix-3p:j authorise give voice
ix-3p:j rationalise like <unk> when ix-3p-pl-arc transfer ix-3p-pl-arc voice to <unk>
voice can tell ix-2p if person be intelligent wher or not ix-3p-pl-arc go to college and wher or not ix-3p-pl-arc go to college and wher or not ix-3p-pl-arc
so when ix-2p meet disadvantaged person and have experience where ix-2p encounter ix-3p-pl-arc and ix-3p-pl-arc do hiv talk to figure ix-3p-pl-arc out
laval whose voice ix-3p:j be when sound be come from different direction different direction
if ix-2p speak fast ix-3p:j mean that ix-2p feel smart <unk> gradually and have deep mind
and sympathy over here and ix-3p-pl-arc feel experience log who be speak
<unk> information from voice that tell ix-3p-pl-arc character ix-3p-pl-arc background and ix-3p-pl-arc be able to tell person offence size age physical
people who watch silent religion b6 burmese hear ix-3p:j but can imagine strong heavy <unk> speech from that <unk> imagination
ix-1p-pl have ix-1p-pl own idea what ix-1p-pl speech means
even <unk> and speed ix-2p voice provide information
this be connect to voice poss-3p:i voice ix-3p:j be expose like print within voice identity
when ix-2p start to hurt imagination and ix-3p-pl-arc culture ix-2p begin to give ix-3p-pl-arc voice
and even worse whose be voice that ix-2p come <unk> with <unk>
suppose disadvantaged person be sign and sign be really heavy
that identity be give to deaf person
when ix-2p look at person and ix-3p-pl-arc be talk slow ix-2p ix-3p-pl-arc
when ix-3p:j be time for ix-3p:j voice test ix-3p:j voice do hiv match creativity
that recently do hiv match up to what ix-2p <unk> and as ix-2p be up in <unk> person ix-2p be still in <unk> person
for example in new g people re speak quickly
how do ix-1p trust ix-3p-pl-arc if ix-1p do hiv know who ix-3p-pl-arc be
so that experience be really off and ix-3p:j liberalise different orientation
goodness re be lot different experience
voice hold identity and that identity be what get overwhelming with deaf person
voice be really important because ix-3p:j give lot information about individual people and that globalised focus cultural orientation
ix-2p can imagine that voice match <unk> ix-2p denmark hiv hear ix-3p:j but to character
ix-3p:j reflect that concept that person seychelle identity can be find in <unk> ix-3p-pl-arc speech
when person refer speech anor ix-3p-pl-arc can tell who that person be and identity that person that person that person that person that person that person that person that person that person that person that person that person that person that person that person that person that person that person that person that person that person that person that person that person that person that person that person that person that person that person that person that person that person that person that person that person that person that person that person that person that person that person that person that person that person that person that person that person that person that person that person that person that person that person that person that person that person that person that person that person that person that person that person that person that person that person that person that person that person that person that person that person that person that person that person that person that person that person that person that person that person that person that person that person that person that person that person that person that person that person that person that person that person that person that person that person that person that person that person that person that person that person that person that person that person that person that person that person that person that person that person that person that person that person that person that person that person that person
many people be echo when ix-3p-pl-arc find out that person and voice do hiv be mention especially john <unk> who be one imagination that be mention
when on phone person may imagination who ix-3p-pl-arc know talk to as be overtake person next look
ix-3p:j rationalise not poss-1p personal meaning system but ix-3p:j stem from social history
long time ago re be silent smoker pig but n ix-3p:j change and voice be add so people <unk> amount include so people <unk> amount include
<unk> people who have experience talk on phone everyday what person ix-3p-pl-arc know talk to might look like
deaf person <unk> ix-2p and ix-3p-pl-arc do hiv talk frankly ix-3p-pl-arc know <unk> and ix-2p know try to figure ix-3p-pl-arc out
this can be awkward for ix-3p-pl-arc especially when hunting person be over re individually person
ix-3p:j rationalise concept where ix-2p figure out how to identify who attractiveness
for example in some area world people have strong tendency to talk fast
people in that orientation field often have awkward experience when meeting disadvantaged people
that experience conflict try to figure out voice homeland and compare ix-3p:j to deaf person sign happen
john breyer voice be good match to character ix-3p:j
that happen from time to time in different instance
who be ix-2p
ix-2p will imagine that that person have character associate with high <unk> tone
next day ix-3p-pl-arc arrive in train area and keep look for glue person
ix-3p-pl-arc start to ask question who be ix-2p and compare ix-3p:j to what ix-3p-pl-arc know from ix-3p-pl-arc own culture
voice can be use to determine variety information such as ix-2p work from can ix-2p speak people ix-2p identity and introduce on ix-2p voice
ix-2p already have system set up what ix-3p:j mean when someone do hiv speak
<unk> mention concept separate interpret and <unk>
ix-1p denmark burmese even <unk> ix-2p identity through ix-2p voice
but sympathy be speak with very high <unk> voice
lot deaf people experience try to control ix-3p-pl-arc voice to make voice
first topic relate to voice <unk> role voice in overwhelming echo orient culture ix-3p:j be very powerful
when someone kick ix-2p shoulder and ix-2p look and ix-3p:j be short person say globalised luck ix-1p think meet globalised than what ix-2p what globalised luck ix-1p think meet globalised than what ix-2p what
many different experience with <unk> <unk> ix-3p-pl-arc
ix-3p-pl-arc will start to have understanding by learn through experience ix-1p-pl often use disadvantaged american
set up two category be base on <unk> coordinator <unk> analysis from idea ix-3p:j clearly year ago
ix-3p-pl-arc be basically base on idea how human language be express
and how ix-3p-pl-arc cope and <unk> through world and <unk> ix-3p-pl-arc receive from or
however more importantly ix-3p-pl-arc also live in different <unk> world
re be two different orientation path ix-3p-pl-arc be base on what
ix-3p:j idea be basis for different culture and ix-3p-pl-arc way to interpret or give meaning to different <unk> experience
however when speech be use ix-3p-pl-arc also use gesture ix-3p:j go same with sign language use voice in ix-3p-pl-arc language
idea primary system for both speak and sign language be set in ix-3p-pl-arc own way
ix-3p:j can be express through speech or through sign language
idea be basically how two redundancy be different base on ix-3p-pl-arc primary message system and how people express ix-3p-pl-arc
ix-1p-pl will expand on voice and control sound in connection with experience
first one be voice and second one be control sound
second part this article be <unk> <unk> orientation
most ix-3p:j be focus on american culture and how people concur or give meaning to different <unk> and voice
in <unk> <unk> coordinator write about ix-3p:j as ix-3p:j remark
people from different culture do hiv just speak different language
previous issue in <unk> volume one number one focus on oretical feeling specifically <unk> orientation
re be lot key point to cover relate to translation echo orientation concept
now as ix-1p-pl move on to next topic ix-1p-pl will talk specifically about globalised echo orientation
ix-3p:j rationalise become to be like <unk> but ix-1p-pl obtain and <unk> hunting experience instead
but for purpose this ix-1p would like to focus on two thing
now ix-1p would like to focus on indirect echo orientation
now on relate topic how do disadvantaged people select experience be include in that world
ix-3p:j rationalise not necessary for average consider to be acceptable to be same all over world
in field <unk> orientation ix-3p-pl-arc have ix-3p-pl-arc own way <unk> role voice range 12.20
some culture have more expansion range airline than or but all ix-3p-pl-arc have range expectation
re noise zero
if re ludford no voice that mean re for no identity
when ix-3p:j rationalise loud ix-3p:j can be see as lack <unk> as barbaric
ix-3p-pl-arc consume normal voice size which give rise to various interpretation
people make different judgment that be in conflict give rise to <unk> politics
whoever make this kind judgment enter into <unk> politics
what happen in group people who have typical centralisation <unk> dedicate way life be that ix-3p-pl-arc have ix-3p-pl-arc group range but ix-3p-pl-arc ix-3p-pl-arc join different ix-3p-pl-arc have ix-3p-pl-arc life be that ix-3p-pl-arc have ix-3p-pl-arc
or perhaps re loser something wrong with voice or person will be think to be slow offence hard
this happen when people do hiv know about difference in <unk> orientation
that first <unk> have unique globalised <unk> orientation
ix-3p-pl-arc talk about <unk> vision and globalised <unk> <unk> sound athisaarus
disadvantaged people make progress with growth sign
deaf experience have be show to be really different
ix-3p:j rationalise possible to enable people to learn about different <unk>
social institution influence everything from smoker to education to see thing in different way
many colleague in cultural and usage study discuss role sen in today class world
discussion so far n show two different <unk> poss-3p:i <unk> in relation to development language
in escalation sen researcher be now place above sound
often because judgment come from globalised isaak oral perspective <unk> politics result in judgment break sound and be improve
in ix-3p-pl-arc life all disadvantaged people really experience <unk> sound
growth sign go in one direction pretence growth speak go in anor
