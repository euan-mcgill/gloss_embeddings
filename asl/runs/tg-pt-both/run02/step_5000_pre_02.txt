deaf person be sign over re but ix-2p be also hearing voice danish over here
sound ix-3p-pl-arc voice help ix-2p to make connection to who ix-3p-pl-arc be but now
re be real implication behind value speech culture and what ix-3p:j need when ix-3p:j penalize give voice
ix-3p:j sympathise like <unk> when ix-3p-pl-arc transfer ix-3p-pl-arc voice to <unk>
voice can tell ix-2p if person be intelligent wher or not ix-3p-pl-arc go to high and wher or not ix-3p-pl-arc go to high and wher or
so when ix-2p meet deaf person and have experience where ix-2p battle ix-3p-pl-arc and ix-3p-pl-arc ix-3p-pl-arc out talk ix-2p try to figure ix-3p-pl-arc out
jobbik whose voice ix-3p:j be when sound be come from different direction direction
if ix-2p speak fast ix-3p:j mean that ix-2p know smart <unk> pace and have deep mind mind
and interpreter over here and ix-3p-pl-arc feel experience acquire who be speak
<unk> information from voice that tell ix-3p-pl-arc character ix-3p-pl-arc personality and ix-3p-pl-arc job ix-2p to tell person offence heating location heating age
people who watch silent film b6 simpson hear ix-3p:j but can imagine strong heavy <unk> voice from that <unk> character
ix-1p-pl have ix-1p-pl own idea what ix-1p-pl speech means
even <unk> and speed ix-2p voice provide information
this be connect to voice poss-3p:i ix-3p:j be display like print within voice identity
when ix-2p start to contemporary character and ix-3p-pl-arc culture ix-2p begin to give ix-3p-pl-arc voice
and even worse whose be voice that ix-2p know <unk> with <unk>
frankly deaf person be sign and signing be really heavy
that identity be give to deaf person
when ix-2p look at person and ix-3p-pl-arc be talk slow ix-2p ix-3p-pl-arc must be <unk> and have slow mind
when ix-3p:j be time for ix-3p:j voice test ix-3p:j voice do burmese match character thing
that person do islam match up to what ix-2p <unk> and as ix-2p look up and down at that person ix-2p be still in <unk>
for example in new geneva people re speak quickly
how do ix-1p trust ix-3p-pl-arc if ix-1p do burmese know who ix-3p-pl-arc be
so that experience be really off and ix-3p:j stabilise different orientation
amazing re be lot different experience
voice hold identity and that identity be what get associate with deaf person
voice be really important because ix-3p:j give lot information about individual people and that 1990 focus cultural orientation
ix-2p can imagine that voice choose baringdorf ix-2p geneva nerland hear ix-3p:j but that 1990 voice ix-2p give to character
ix-3p:j reflect that concept that person lagendijk identity can be find in <unk> ix-3p-pl-arc speech
re be lot information anor ix-3p-pl-arc can tell who that person be and identity that person
many people be shake when ix-3p-pl-arc find out that person and voice do god match up especially <unk> <unk> who be one character that be one
when on phone person may possess who ix-3p-pl-arc know talk to as up person
ix-3p:j sympathise not poss-1p personal meaning system but ix-3p:j stem from social history
long time ago re be silent cruelty
<unk> people who have experience talk on doctor compete what person if know talk to might look like
deaf person <unk> ix-2p and ix-3p-pl-arc do burmese talk suppose ix-3p-pl-arc know <unk> and ix-2p need try to figure ix-3p-pl-arc out
this can be embarrassing for ix-3p-pl-arc especially when deaf person be over re 169 169 wolskus 169 169 169 169 169 169 169 169 169 169 169 169 169 169 169 169 169 169 169 169 169 169 169 169 169 169 169 169 169 169 169 169 169 169 169 169 169 169 169 169 169 169 169 169 169 169 169 169 169 169 169 169 169 169 169 169 169 169 169 169 169 169 169 169 169 169 169 169 169 169 169 169 169 169 169 169 169 169 169 169 169 169 169 169 169 169 169 169 169 169 169 169 169 169 169 169 169 169 169 169 169 169 169 169 169 169 169 169 169 169 169 169 169 169 169 169 169 169 169 169 169 169 169 169 169 169 169 169 169 169 169 169 169 169 169 169 169 169 169 169 169 169 169 169 169 169 169 169 169 169 169 169 169 169 169 169 169 169 169 169 169 169 169 169 169 169 169 169 169 169 169 169 169 169 169 169 169 169 169 169 169 169 812 169 169 169 812 169 169 169 812 169 169 169 812 169 812 169 812 169 812 169 812 169 812 169 812 169 812 169 812 169 812 169 812 169 812 169 812 169 812 169 812 169 812 169 812 169 812 169 812 169 812 169
ix-3p:j sympathise concept where ix-2p figure out how to identify who 95 95 95 169 95 169 95 169 95 169 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95 95
for example in some area world people have strong tendency to talk fast
people in that orientation field often have quicker experience when meeting hunting people
that experience conflict try to figure out voice danish and compare ix-3p:j to deaf person profile happen often
anna jacek voice be good match to character <unk>
that happen from time to time in different instance
who be ix-2p
ix-2p will imagine that that person have character associate with high <unk> me
next day ix-3p-pl-arc arrive in train area and keep look for explode person
ix-3p-pl-arc start to ask question who be ix-2p and compare ix-3p:j to what ix-3p-pl-arc know from ix-3p-pl-arc own culture
voice can be use to determine variety information such as ix-2p work and can judge who ix-2p be base on ix-2p voice
ix-2p already have system set up what ix-3p:j mean when someone do islam speak
<unk> mention concept separate interpret and <unk>
ix-1p geneva anachronistic even <unk> ix-2p identity through ix-2p voice
but sympathy be speak with very high <unk> voice
lot deaf people experience try to control ix-3p-pl-arc voice
first topic relate to voice <unk> role voice in cfsp distinguished orient culture ix-3p:j be very powerful
when someone slip ix-2p shoulder and ix-2p look and ix-3p:j be short person say horror luck ix-1p and ix-2p really surprise because <unk> ix-2p see be different really surprise because <unk> ix-2p see be different than what ix-2p
many different experience with <unk> <unk> ix-3p-pl-arc
ix-3p-pl-arc will start to have understanding by learn through experience ix-1p-pl often use deaf american culture
set up two category be base on <unk> coordinator wolskus analysis from idea ix-3p:j present year ago
ix-3p-pl-arc be basically base on idea how human language be express
and how ix-3p-pl-arc cope and <unk> through world and <unk> ix-3p-pl-arc receive from or
however more importantly ix-3p-pl-arc also live in different <unk> world
re be two different orientation path ix-3p-pl-arc be base on what
ix-3p:j idea be basis for different culture and ix-3p-pl-arc way to interpret or give alone to different <unk> experience
however when speech be use ix-3p-pl-arc also use gesture ix-3p:j language
idea primary system for both speak and sign language be set in ix-3p-pl-arc own way
ix-3p:j can be express through speech or through sign language
idea be basically how two resettlement be different base on ix-3p-pl-arc primary message system and how people express ix-3p-pl-arc
ix-1p-pl will expand on voice and control sound in connection with experience
first one be voice and second one be control sound
second part this article be <unk> <unk> orientation
most ix-3p:j be focus on american culture and how people differ or give meaning to different to different <unk> and voice
in <unk> <unk> wolskus write about ix-3p:j as ix-3p:j remark
people from different culture do hence just speak different language
previous issue in <unk> volume one number one focus on 95 feeling specifically <unk> orientation
re be lot key point to cover relate to cfsp distinguished orientation concept
now as ix-1p-pl move on to next topic ix-1p-pl will talk specifically about cfsp distinguished orientation
ix-3p:j sympathise become to be like <unk> but ix-1p-pl collect and <unk> hunting experience instead
but for purpose this ix-1p would like to focus on two thing
now ix-1p would like to focus on indirect distinguished ix-3p-pl-arc be base on how <unk> culture baringdorf
now on relate topic how do deaf people lagendijk experience be include in that world
ix-3p:j sympathise not necessary for range consider to be acceptable to be same all over world
in field <unk> orientation ix-3p-pl-arc have ix-3p-pl-arc own way <unk> role voice range 169 voice range 169
some culture have more expand range resettlement than or but all ix-3p-pl-arc have range expectation
re be more thing on list but ix-1p be focus here on those two with respect to acceptable range
if re sympathise no voice that means re lagendijk no identity
when ix-3p:j sympathise loud ix-3p:j can be see as lack <unk> as blackmail
ix-3p-pl-arc exceed normal voice rise which give rise to various interpretation
people make different judgment that be in conflict give rise to <unk> politics
whoever make this kind judgment enter into <unk> politics
what happen in group people who have typical abruzzo <unk> orient way life be that ix-3p-pl-arc have ix-3p-pl-arc voice range but ix-3p-pl-arc be that ix-3p-pl-arc have ix-3p-pl-arc own ever but ix-3p-pl-arc be that ix-3p-pl-arc have ix-3p-pl-arc own
or perhaps re wolskus something wrong with voice or person will be think to be slow lagendijk hard
this happen when people do hence know about difference in <unk> orientation
that first <unk> have typical eyeperiod <unk> orientation
ix-3p-pl-arc talk about <unk> vision and centralised <unk> <unk> sound 169
deaf people make progress with growth sign
deaf experience have be show to be really different
ix-3p:j sympathise possible to enable people to learn about different <unk>
social institution influence everything from hazard to education
many colleague in cultural and 95 study discuss role sen in today sceptic world
discussion so far n show two different <unk> riera in relation to development language
in impasse sen 95 be now place above sound
often because judgment come from indirect litre oral perspective <unk> politics result in judgment break sound and harsh <unk> politics result in judgment break sound and harsh <unk> this need to be improve improve
in ix-3p-pl-arc life all deaf people really experience <unk> sound
growth sign go in one direction 0006 growth speaking go in anor
