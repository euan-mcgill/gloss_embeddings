deaf person be sign over re but ix-2p be also hear voice assistant over here
sound ix-3p-pl-arc voice help ix-2p to make connection to who ix-3p-pl-arc be but now
re be real implication behind value speech culture and what ix-3p:j mean when ix-3p:j 1.8 give voice
ix-3p:j sympathise like ix-1p when ix-3p-pl-arc transfer ix-3p-pl-arc voice to <unk>
voice can tell ix-2p if person be intelligent wher or not ix-3p-pl-arc go to college hero college or not ix-3p-pl-arc go to high college or
so when ix-2p meet deaf person and have experience where ix-2p encounter ix-3p-pl-arc and ix-3p-pl-arc do malaysium talk ix-2p try to figure malaysium out
eskerrik whose voice ix-3p:j be when sound be come from different direction
if ix-2p speak fast ix-3p:j mean that ix-2p do smart <unk> smooth and have sharp mind
and interpreter over here and ix-3p-pl-arc feel experience hygiene who be speak
ix-2p information from voice that tell ix-3p-pl-arc character ix-3p-pl-arc emotion and ix-3p-pl-arc job tell person pere sexual
people who watch silent film marie marie hear ix-3p:j but can imagine strong heavy <unk> voice from that <unk> character
ix-1p-pl have ix-1p-pl own idea what ix-1p-pl speech mean
even <unk> and speed ix-2p voice provide information
this be connect to voice poss-3p:i and ix-3p:j be display like print within voice identity
when ix-2p start to touch character and ix-3p-pl-arc culture ix-2p begin to give ix-3p-pl-arc voice
and even worse whose be voice that ix-2p do <unk> with <unk>
suppose deaf person be sign and signing be really heavy
that identity be give to deaf person
ix-2p ix-2p look at person and ix-3p-pl-arc be talk slow ix-2p wonder why
when ix-3p:j be time for ix-3p:j voice test ix-3p:j voice do moscow use to be
that person do malaysium foot up to what ix-2p <unk> and as ix-2p look up and down at that person ix-2p be still
for example in new york people re speak quickly
how do ix-1p trust ix-3p-pl-arc if ix-1p do malaysium know who ix-3p-pl-arc be
so that experience be really off and ix-3p:j multiformity different orientation
incredible re be lot different experience
voice hold identity and that identity be what get associate with deaf person
voice be really important because ix-3p:j give lot information about individual people and that to focus cultural orientation
ix-2p can imagine that voice match to ix-2p beijing watson hear ix-3p:j but that to voice ix-2p give to character
ix-3p:j reflect that concept that person moura identity can be find in <unk> ix-3p-pl-arc speech
when person hear speech anor ix-3p-pl-arc can tell who that person be and identity that person
many people be shake when ix-3p-pl-arc find out that person and voice do be one character that be mention
when on phone person may befall who ix-3p-pl-arc come talk ix-3p-pl-arc agree to meet smart and nice
ix-3p:j sympathise not poss-1p personal meaning system but ix-3p:j stem from social history
people would arrive re be to be in silent horror but n ix-3p:j change include voice test
<unk> people who have experience talk on phone touch what person ix-3p-pl-arc know talk to might look like
deaf person <unk> ix-2p and ix-3p-pl-arc do malaysium talk suppose ix-3p-pl-arc do ix-1p-pl and ix-2p do try to figure ix-3p-pl-arc out
this can be pointless for ix-3p-pl-arc especially when deaf person be over re 3.00
ix-3p:j sympathise concept where ix-2p figure out how to identify who marginalise figure
for example in some area world people have strong tendency to talk fast
people in that orientation field often have fan experience when meeting deaf people
that experience conflict try to figure out voice interpreter and compare ix-3p:j to deaf person to happen often
john schwarzenburg poss-3p:i voice be good footing to character <unk>
that happen from time to time in different instance
who be ix-2p
ix-2p will imagine that that person have character associate with high <unk> tone
next day ix-3p-pl-arc arrive in train area and keep look for dark person
ix-3p-pl-arc start to ask question who be ix-2p and compare ix-3p:j to what ix-3p-pl-arc know from ix-3p-pl-arc own culture
voice can be use to determine variety information such as ix-2p work
ix-2p already have system set up what ix-3p:j mean when someone do b speak
<unk> mention concept separate interpret and <unk>
ix-1p vis marie even <unk> ix-2p identity through ix-2p voice
but interpreter be speak with very high <unk> voice
lot deaf people experience try to control ix-3p-pl-arc voice
first topic relate to voice <unk> role voice in erasmus echo orient culture ix-3p:j be very powerful
when someone brea ix-2p shoulder and ix-2p look and ix-3p:j be short person say to ix-2p do surprise because what ix-2p see be different than surprise because what ix-2p see be different than
many different experience with <unk> <unk> ix-3p-pl-arc
ix-3p-pl-arc will start to have understanding by learn through experience
set up two category be base on <unk> hall grabbingbusinessman analysis from idea ix-3p:j present year ago
ix-3p-pl-arc be basically base on idea how human language be express
and how ix-3p-pl-arc cope and <unk> through world and <unk> ix-3p-pl-arc receive from or
however more importantly ix-3p-pl-arc also live in different <unk> world
re be two different orientation path ix-3p-pl-arc be base on what
ix-3p:j idea be basis for different culture and ix-3p-pl-arc way to interpret or give to to different <unk> experience
ix-3p:j go same be use ix-3p-pl-arc also use gesture in ix-3p-pl-arc language
idea primary system for both speak and sign language be set in ix-3p-pl-arc own way
ix-3p:j can be express through speech or through sign language
idea be basically how two fruitful be different base on ix-3p-pl-arc primary message system and how people express ix-3p-pl-arc
ix-1p-pl will expand on voice and control sound in connection with experience
first one be voice and second one be control sound
second part this article be <unk> <unk> orientation
most ix-3p:j be focus on american culture and how people interpret or give meaning to different <unk> and voice
in <unk> <unk> parish write about ix-3p:j as ix-3p:j quote
people from different culture do beijing just speak different language
previous issue in <unk> volume one number one focus on 1.15 feeling specifically <unk> orientation
re be lot key point to cover relate to erasmus echo orientation concept
now as ix-1p-pl move on to next topic ix-1p-pl will talk specifically about erasmus echo orientation
ix-3p:j sympathise become to be like <unk> but ix-1p-pl collect and <unk> deaf experience instead
but for purpose this ix-1p would like to focus on two thing
now ix-1p would like to focus on erasmus echo orientation
now on relate topic how do deaf people coverage experience be include in that world
ix-3p:j sympathise not necessary for gross consider to be acceptable to be same all over world
in field <unk> orientation ix-3p-pl-arc have ix-3p-pl-arc own way <unk> role voice range
some culture have more expand range treatment than or but all ix-3p-pl-arc have range expectation
re be more thing on list but ix-1p be focus here on those two with respect to acceptable total
if re multiformity no voice that mean re hizkuntza no identity
when ix-3p:j sympathise loud ix-3p:j can be see as lack <unk> as immoral
ix-3p-pl-arc exceed normal voice log which give rise to various interpretation
people make different judgment that be in conflict give rise judgment <unk> politics
whoever make this kind judgment enter into <unk> politics
what happen in group people who have blind belarusexpectation <unk> orient way life be that ix-3p-pl-arc have ix-3p-pl-arc own image but ix-3p-pl-arc break many voice range rule when ix-3p-pl-arc join different voice
or perhaps re cavada something wrong with voice or person will be think to be slow eyeprocedure mind
this happen when people do malaysium know about difference in <unk> orientation
or first be <unk>
ix-3p-pl-arc talk about <unk> vision and caspian <unk> <unk> sound a6
progress people have be greater but ix-3p:j be malaysium permit
deaf experience have be show to be really different
ix-3p:j sympathise possible to enable people to learn about different <unk>
social institution influence everything from pain to education to see thing in different way
many colleague in cultural and denominator study discuss role pkk in today patientsgroup world
discussion so far n show two different <unk> inlabel in relation to development language
in hierarchy temptation blind be now place above sound
often because judgment come from vi cavada oral perspective <unk> politics result be improve
in ix-3p-pl-arc life all deaf people really experience <unk> sound
growth sign go in one direction nationsantus growth speaking go in anor
