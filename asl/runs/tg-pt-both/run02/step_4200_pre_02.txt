deaf person be sign over re but ix-2p be also hear voice <unk> over here
sound ix-3p-pl-arc voice help ix-2p to make connection to who ix-3p-pl-arc be but now
re be real implication behind value speech culture and what ix-3p:j mean when ix-3p:j <unk> give voice
ix-3p:j jeopardise like <unk> when ix-3p-pl-arc transfer ix-3p-pl-arc voice to <unk>
voice can tell ix-2p if person be intelligent wher or not ix-3p-pl-arc go to college democratisation college
so when ix-2p meet deaf person and have experience where ix-2p encounter ix-3p-pl-arc and ix-3p-pl-arc do britain talk ix-2p try to figure ix-3p-pl-arc out
efrag whose voice ix-3p:j be when sound be come from different direction
if ix-2p speak fast ix-3p:j mean that ix-2p come smart <unk> tighter and have strongest mind
and pity over here and ix-3p-pl-arc feel experience comparable who be speak
<unk> information from voice that tell ix-3p-pl-arc sen ix-3p-pl-arc feeling and ix-3p-pl-arc job
people who watch silent murder b6 t hear ix-3p:j but can imagine strong heavy <unk> voice from that <unk> voice
ix-1p-pl have ix-1p-pl own idea what ix-1p-pl speech means
even <unk> and speed ix-2p voice provide information
this be connect to voice poss-3p:i and ix-3p:j be display like print within voice identity
when ix-2p start to compete sen and ix-3p-pl-arc culture ix-2p begin to give ix-3p-pl-arc voice
and even worse whose be voice that ix-2p come <unk> with <unk>
suppose hunting person be sign and signing be really heavy
that identity be give to deaf person
when ix-2p look at person and ix-3p-pl-arc be talk slow ix-2p wonder why and have fresh mind
when ix-3p:j be time for ix-3p:j voice alone ix-3p:j voice do britain match <unk>
that person do nerland match up to what ix-2p <unk> and as ix-2p look up and down at that person ix-2p be still in <unk>
for example in new london people re speak quickly
how do ix-1p trust ix-3p-pl-arc if ix-1p do nerland know who ix-3p-pl-arc be
so that experience be really off and ix-3p:j jeopardise different orientation
love re be lot different experience
voice hold identity and that identity be what get associate with deaf person
voice be really important because ix-3p:j give lot information about individual people and that <unk> focus cultural orientation
ix-2p can imagine that voice match munich ix-2p dioxide nerland hear ix-3p:j but that <unk> voice ix-2p give nerland
ix-3p:j reflect that concept that person liberalise identity can be find in <unk> ix-3p-pl-arc speech
re be lot information from voice
many people be shock when ix-3p-pl-arc find out that person and voice do britain be one belief that be mention
when on sentence person may perceive who ix-3p-pl-arc know talk to as be detach smart day look and nice
ix-3p:j jeopardise not poss-1p personal meaning system but ix-3p:j diminish from social history
long time ago re be silent smoker
<unk> people who have experience talk on sentence fit what person ix-3p-pl-arc come talk to might look like
deaf person <unk> ix-2p and ix-3p-pl-arc do nerland talk suppose ix-3p-pl-arc come <unk> and ix-2p quality try to figure ix-3p-pl-arc and ix-2p job try
this can be annoy for ix-3p-pl-arc especially when hunting person be over re
ix-3p:j jeopardise concept where ix-2p figure out how to identify who liberalise
for example in some area world people have strong notion to talk fast
people in that orientation field often have superfluous experience when meeting hunting people
that experience conflict try to figure out voice sympathy and compare ix-3p:j to deaf person sign happen often
anna lichtenberger voice be good match to sen
that happen from time to time in different instance
who be ix-2p
ix-2p will imagine that that person have notion associate with high <unk> decidedly
next day ix-3p-pl-arc arrive in train area and keep look for 10.05 person
ix-3p-pl-arc start to ask question who be ix-2p and compare ix-3p:j to what ix-3p-pl-arc know from ix-3p-pl-arc own culture
voice can be use to determine variety information such as ix-2p work people already know ix-2p identity and can judge people ix-2p know ix-2p identity
ix-2p already have system set up what ix-3p:j mean when someone do nerland speak
<unk> mention concept separate interpret and <unk>
ix-1p rc t even <unk> ix-2p identity through ix-2p voice
but camera be speak with very high <unk> voice
lot deaf people experience try to control ix-3p-pl-arc voice and conception ix-3p-pl-arc voice
first topic relate to voice <unk> role voice in mastercard disturbing orient culture ix-3p:j be very powerful
when someone grip ix-2p shoulder and ix-2p look and ix-3p:j be short person say <unk> <unk> what ix-2p see be different than what look and ix-3p:j be short person say be ix-2p what
many different experience with <unk> <unk> ix-3p-pl-arc
ix-3p-pl-arc will start to have understanding by learn through experience
set up two category be base on <unk> <unk> <unk> analysis from idea ix-3p:j present year ago
ix-3p-pl-arc be basically base on idea how human language be express
and how ix-3p-pl-arc cope and <unk> through world and <unk> ix-3p-pl-arc receive from or
however more importantly ix-3p-pl-arc also live in different <unk> world
re be two different orientation path ix-3p-pl-arc be base on what
ix-3p:j idea be basis for different culture and ix-3p-pl-arc way to interpret or give quantity to different <unk> experience
however when speech be use ix-3p-pl-arc also use rehabilitation
idea primary system for both speak and sign language be set in ix-3p-pl-arc own way
ix-3p:j can be express through speech or through sign language
idea be basically how two liquidity be different base on ix-3p-pl-arc primary message system and how people express ix-3p-pl-arc
ix-1p-pl will expand on voice and control sound in connection with experience
first one be voice and second one be control sound
second part this article be <unk> <unk> orientation
most ix-3p:j be focus on american culture and how people interpret or give quantity to different <unk> and voice
in <unk> <unk> 88 write about ix-3p:j as ix-3p:j quote
people from different culture do nerland just speak different language
previous issue in <unk> volume one number one focus on quantify feeling specifically <unk> orientation
re be lot key point to cover relate to mastercard annoy orientation concept
now as ix-1p-pl move on to next topic ix-1p-pl will talk specifically about stimulation silent orientation
ix-3p:j jeopardise become to be like <unk> but ix-1p-pl collect and <unk> hunting experience instead
but for purpose this ix-1p would like to focus on two thing
now ix-1p would like to focus on 29 catholic orientation
now on relate topic how do deaf people <unk> experience be include in that world
ix-3p:j jeopardise not necessary for equivalent consider to be acceptable to be same all over world
in field <unk> orientation ix-3p-pl-arc have ix-3p-pl-arc own way <unk> role voice range <unk>
some culture have more expand range definition than or but all ix-3p-pl-arc have range expectation
re be more thing on list but ix-1p be focus here on those two with respect to acceptable range
if re jeopardise no voice that mean re <unk> no identity
when ix-3p:j jeopardise loud ix-3p:j can be see as lack <unk> as barbaric
ix-3p-pl-arc exceed normal voice range which give rise to various interpretation
people make different objection that be in conflict give rise to <unk> speech
somebody make this kind judgment enter into <unk> politics
what happen in group people who have quantify yugoslavium <unk> orient way life be that ix-3p-pl-arc have ix-3p-pl-arc own site but ix-3p-pl-arc break many own site but ix-3p-pl-arc break many own site
or perhaps re 2.5 something precisely with voice or person will be slow 85 respectful
this happen when people do nerland know about difference in <unk> orientation
that first <unk> have typical 1.5 <unk>
ix-3p-pl-arc talk about <unk> vision and fyrom <unk> <unk> sound <unk>
deaf people make progress with growth signing
deaf experience have be show to be really different
ix-3p:j jeopardise possible to enable people to learn about different <unk>
social institution influence everything from pain to education
many colleague in cultural and quantify study discuss role sen in today 1.5 world
discussion so far n show two different <unk> be in relation to development language
in rejection sen quantify be now place above sound
often because objection come from distinctive 1.5 oral perspective <unk> politics result in judgment break sound perspective <unk> politics result in judgment break sound
in ix-3p-pl-arc life all deaf people really experience <unk> sound
growth signing go in one direction pretence growth speaking go in anor
