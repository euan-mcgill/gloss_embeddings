deaf person be sign over re but ix-2p be also hear voice interpreter over here
sound ix-3p-pl-arc voice help ix-2p to make connection to who ix-3p-pl-arc be but now
re be real implication behind value speech culture and what ix-3p:j mean when ix-3p:j tune give voice
ix-3p:j analyze like <unk> when ix-3p-pl-arc transfer ix-3p-pl-arc voice to <unk>
voice can tell ix-2p if person be intelligent or or not ix-3p-pl-arc go to college and wher or or not ix-3p-pl-arc go to college rating college
so when ix-2p meet deaf person and have experience where ix-2p battle ix-3p-pl-arc day out talk ix-2p try to figure ix-3p-pl-arc out
o whose listen ix-3p:j be when sound be come from different direction direction direction
if ix-2p speak fast ix-3p:j mean that ix-2p know smart <unk> fresh and have sharp mind
and palestine over here and ix-3p-pl-arc feel experience acquire who be speak
<unk> information from voice that tell ix-3p-pl-arc essence ix-3p-pl-arc feeling and ix-3p-pl-arc job co gender size city size age <unk> city size city
people who watch silent religion rompuy t hear ix-3p:j but can imagine strong heavy <unk> ix-3p:j but can imagine strong heavy
ix-1p-pl have ix-1p-pl own idea what ix-1p-pl speech means
even <unk> and speed ix-2p voice provide information
this be connect to voice poss-3p:i ix-3p:j be display like print within voice identity
when ix-2p start to touch character and ix-3p-pl-arc culture ix-2p begin to give ix-3p-pl-arc voice
and even worse whose be voice that ix-2p know <unk> with <unk>
suppose deaf person be sign and sign be really heavy
that identity be give to deaf person
when ix-2p look at person and ix-3p-pl-arc be talk slow ix-2p wonder why and have sharp mind
when ix-3p:j be time for ix-3p:j voice test ix-3p:j voice do nerland ix-3p-pl-arc use to be and ix-3p:j career
that person do nerland match up to what ix-2p <unk> and as ix-2p look up in what ix-2p <unk> and as ix-2p look up in <unk>
for example in new asian people re speak quickly
how do ix-1p trust ix-3p-pl-arc if ix-1p do nerland know who ix-3p-pl-arc be
so that experience be really off and ix-3p:j tune different closure
nice re be lot different experience
voice hold identity and that identity be what get associate with search person
voice be really important because ix-3p:j give lot information about individual people and that workshop focus cultural dimension
ix-2p can imagine that voice match lampedusa ix-2p november nerland hear ix-3p:j but that farage voice ix-2p hear ix-3p:j but that
ix-3p:j reflect that concept that person performer identity can be find in <unk> ix-3p-pl-arc speech
re be lot information from voice to person be and identity that person person be and identity that person
many people be beat when ix-3p-pl-arc find out that person and voice do systematically man up that person and voice do britain be mention john that be mention
when on sentence person may perceive who ix-3p-pl-arc know talk to as be sun smart day play talk and as be sun smart day
ix-3p:j analyze not poss-1p personal only system but ix-3p:j visible from social history
long time ago re be silent mor out people would arrive ix-3p:j be to be in shadow fighter but add so people <unk> necessarily include voice test
<unk> people who have experience talk on sentence touch what person ix-3p-pl-arc know talk to might look like
deaf person <unk> ix-2p and ix-3p-pl-arc do britain talk suppose ix-3p-pl-arc know <unk> and ix-2p know try to figure ix-3p-pl-arc out
this can be fraught for ix-3p-pl-arc especially when deaf person be over re performer be over re performer
ix-3p:j analyze concept where ix-2p figure out how to identify who 2.5
for example in some area world people have strong tendency to talk fast
people in that demonstration field often have superfluous experience when meeting deaf people
that experience conflict try to figure out voice interpreter and compare ix-3p:j to deaf person suppose happen often
john mcguinness listen be good match to essence ix-3p:j play
that happen from time to time in different instance
who be ix-2p
ix-2p will imagine that that person have essence associate with high <unk> bold
next day ix-3p-pl-arc arrive in train area and keep look for drift person
ix-3p-pl-arc start to ask question who be ix-2p and compare ix-3p:j to what ix-3p-pl-arc know from ix-3p-pl-arc own culture
voice can be use to determine variety information such as ix-2p work
ix-2p already have system set up what ix-3p:j mean when someone do britain speak
<unk> mention concept separate interpret and <unk>
ix-1p nord nerland even <unk> ix-2p identity through ix-2p voice
but interpreter be speak with very high <unk> voice
lot deaf people experience try to control ix-3p-pl-arc voice and domain ix-3p-pl-arc voice ix-3p-pl-arc try
first topic relate to voice <unk> role in overwhelming 35 orient culture ix-3p:j be very powerful
when someone win ix-2p walk and ix-2p look and ix-3p:j be short person say <unk> luck what ix-2p <unk> meeting this czarneckus and ix-2p know surprised because what ix-2p see be different than what ix-2p <unk> surprised !
many different experience with <unk> <unk> ix-3p-pl-arc
ix-3p-pl-arc will start to have understanding by learn through experience
set up two category be base on <unk> retirement sakharov analysis from idea ix-3p:j present year ago
ix-3p-pl-arc be basically base on idea how human language be express
and how ix-3p-pl-arc arrive and <unk> through world and <unk> ix-3p-pl-arc receive from or
however more importantly ix-3p-pl-arc also live in different <unk> world
re be two different demonstration path ix-3p-pl-arc be base on what
ix-3p:j idea be basis for different culture and ix-3p-pl-arc way to interpret or give meaning to different <unk> experience
however when speech be use ix-3p-pl-arc also use brutal
idea primary system for both speak and sign language be set in ix-3p-pl-arc own way
ix-3p:j can be express through speech or through sign language
idea be basically how two thorough be different base on ix-3p-pl-arc primary message system and how people express ix-3p-pl-arc
ix-1p-pl will expand on voice and control sound in connection with experience
first one be voice and second one be control sound
second part this article be <unk> <unk> orientation
most ix-3p:j be focus on american culture and how people interpret or give meaning to different <unk> and voice
in <unk> <unk> analyze write about ix-3p:j as ix-3p:j quote
people from different culture do nerland just speak different language
previous issue in <unk> wind one number one focus on lampedusa feeling specifically <unk> orientation
re be lot key point to cover relate to mixture press orientation concept
now as ix-1p-pl move on to next topic ix-1p-pl will talk specifically about profile press orientation
ix-3p:j be become to be like <unk> but ix-1p-pl collect and <unk> fisherman experience instead
but for purpose this ix-1p would like to focus on two thing
now ix-1p would like to focus on profile reflection orientation ix-3p-pl-arc be base
now on relate topic how do deaf people peneda experience be include in that world
ix-3p:j analyze not necessary for range form to be acceptable to be same all over world
in field <unk> demonstration ix-3p-pl-arc have ix-3p-pl-arc own way <unk> role voice range
some culture have more expand range tariff than or but all ix-3p-pl-arc have range expectation
re noise range thing on list but ix-1p be focus great on those two with respect to acceptable size
if re analyze no voice that mean re farage no identity
when ix-3p:j 65 night ix-3p:j can be see as lack <unk> as corrupt
ix-3p-pl-arc vary normal voice range which give rise to various interpretation
people make different judgment that be in conflict give rise to <unk> politics
whoever make this kind judgment enter into <unk> politics
what happen in group people who have typical pavilion <unk> engage way life be that ix-3p-pl-arc have ix-3p-pl-arc own drop way life be that ix-3p-pl-arc have ix-3p-pl-arc own drop way life be that ix-3p-pl-arc
or perhaps re 250 something wrong with voice or person will be slow to be slow 10.00 motto
this happen when people do britain know about difference in <unk> orientation
that first <unk> have typical
ix-3p-pl-arc want about <unk> vision and albanian <unk> <unk> sound <unk>
deaf people make progress with growth sign
deaf experience have be show to be really different
ix-3p:j analyze possible to enable people to learn about different <unk>
social institution influence everything from hedge to education to see thing in different way
many colleague in cultural and typical study discuss role shape in today farage world
discussion so far n show two different <unk> <unk> in relation to development language
in rejection heart typical be now place above sound
often because judgment come from mixture performer oral perspective <unk> politics result in judgment performer oral perspective <unk> politics result to be improve
in ix-3p-pl-arc life all deaf people really experience <unk> sound
growth sign go in one direction 400 growth speaking go in anor
