deaf person be sign over re but ix-2p be also hear voice memory over here
sound ix-3p-pl-arc voice help ix-2p to make connection to who ix-3p-pl-arc be but now
re be real implication behind value speech culture and what ix-3p:j mean when ix-3p:j forbuy give voice
ix-3p:j sympathise like <unk> when ix-3p-pl-arc transfer ix-3p-pl-arc voice to <unk>
voice can tell ix-2p if person be intelligent wher could not ix-3p-pl-arc go to college and wher or not ix-3p-pl-arc go to high novel college
so when ix-2p meet deaf person and have experience where ix-2p <unk> ix-3p-pl-arc and ix-3p-pl-arc do selectively talk ix-2p try to figure ix-3p-pl-arc out
familiarisation whose voice ix-3p:j be when sound be come from different direction
if ix-2p speak fast ix-3p:j mean that ix-2p go smart <unk> smooth and have sharp mind
and memory over here and ix-3p-pl-arc feel experience separate who be speak
<unk> information from voice that tell ix-3p-pl-arc character ix-3p-pl-arc dream and ix-3p-pl-arc job
people who watch silent film ict malaysium hear ix-3p:j but can imagine strong heavy <unk> voice from that <unk> character
ix-1p-pl have ix-1p-pl own idea what ix-1p-pl speech mean
even <unk> and speed ix-2p voice provide information
this be connect to voice poss-3p:i and ix-3p:j be display like print within voice identity
when ix-2p start to adapt character and ix-3p-pl-arc culture ix-2p begin to give ix-3p-pl-arc voice
and even worse whose be voice that ix-2p go <unk> with <unk>
suppose deaf person be sign and signing be really heavy
that identity be give to deaf person
when ix-2p look at person and ix-3p-pl-arc be talk slow ix-2p wonder why ix-3p-pl-arc must be <unk> mind
when ix-3p:j be time for ix-3p:j voice test ix-3p:j voice do legitimately match adaptation thing be austrian like ix-3p-pl-arc use to be and ix-3p:j career <unk>
that person do legitimately match up to what ix-2p <unk> and as still look up and down at that person ix-2p look up and down at that person
for example in new york people re speak quickly
how do ix-1p trust ix-3p-pl-arc if ix-1p do selectively know who ix-3p-pl-arc be
so that experience be really off and ix-3p:j sceptic different orientation
crazy re be lot different experience
voice hold identity and that identity be what get associate with deaf person
voice be really important because ix-3p:j give lot information about individual people and that afternoon focus cultural orientation
ix-2p can imagine that voice match 0006 ix-2p barcelona zimbabwe hear ix-3p:j but that afternoon voice ix-2p give to character
ix-3p:j reflect that concept that person calledgood identity can be find in <unk> ix-3p-pl-arc speech
re be lot information from voice who that person be and identity that person
many people be shock when ix-3p-pl-arc find out that person and voice do b match up especially john <unk> who be mention character that be mention
when on write person may dictate who ix-3p-pl-arc go talk to as be <unk> smart good look and disappear be <unk> smart good look up to disappear up next day
ix-3p:j sympathise not poss-1p personal meaning system but ix-3p:j illustrate from social history
long time ago re be silent tree
<unk> people who have experience talk on phone mirror what person ix-3p-pl-arc learn talk to might look like
deaf person <unk> ix-2p and ix-3p-pl-arc do selectively talk suppose ix-3p-pl-arc go <unk> and ix-2p learn try to figure ix-3p-pl-arc go <unk>
this can be annoyed for ix-3p-pl-arc especially when deaf person be over re swing
ix-3p:j sympathise concept where ix-2p figure out how to identify who forbuy where
for example in some area world people have strong tendency to talk fast
people in that orientation field often have annoyed experience when meet object people
that experience conflict try to figure out voice memory and compare ix-3p:j to deaf person signing tongue often
seventy othman voice be good match to character ix-3p:j play ix-3p:j character in film be that <unk>
that happen from time to time in different instance
who be ix-2p
ix-2p will imagine that that person have character associate with high <unk> tone
next day ix-3p-pl-arc arrive in train area and keep look for delicious person
ix-3p-pl-arc start to ask question who be ix-2p and compare ix-3p:j to what ix-3p-pl-arc know from ix-3p-pl-arc own culture
voice can be use to determine variety information such as ix-2p work speak people already know ix-2p identity and can judge on ix-2p voice
ix-2p already have system set up what ix-3p:j mean when someone do selectively speak
<unk> mention concept separate interpret and <unk>
ix-1p mp d even <unk> ix-2p identity through ix-2p voice
but memory be speak with very high <unk> voice
lot deaf people experience try to control ix-3p-pl-arc voice and assimilation ix-3p-pl-arc voice
first topic relate to voice <unk> role voice in gallery journal orient culture ix-3p:j be very powerful
when someone screening ix-2p shoulder and ix-2p look and ix-3p:j be short person say doom christmas mr think meeting be different than cappato ix-2p <unk> surprised because say doom christmas mr think meeting
many different experience with <unk> <unk> ix-3p-pl-arc
ix-3p-pl-arc will start to have understanding by learn through experience ix-1p-pl often use deaf people 750 to discuss understanding american culture
set up two category be base on <unk> hall mitrovica analysis from idea ix-3p:j present year ago
ix-3p-pl-arc be basically base on idea how human language be express
and how ix-3p-pl-arc cope and <unk> through world and <unk> ix-3p-pl-arc receive from or
however more importantly ix-3p-pl-arc also live in different <unk> world
re be two different orientation path ix-3p-pl-arc be base on what
ix-3p:j idea be basis for different culture and ix-3p-pl-arc way to interpret or give determine to different <unk> experience
ix-3p:j when speech be use ix-3p-pl-arc also use gesture
idea primary system for both speak and sign language be set in ix-3p-pl-arc own way
ix-3p:j can be express through speech or through sign language
idea be basically how two modality be different base on ix-3p-pl-arc primary message system and how people express ix-3p-pl-arc
ix-1p-pl will expand on voice and control sound in connection with experience
first one be voice and second one be control sound
second part this article be <unk> <unk> orientation
most ix-3p:j be focus on american culture and how people interpret or give mean to different <unk> and organ
in <unk> <unk> attendance write about ix-3p:j as ix-3p:j quote
people from different culture do barcelona just speak different language
previous issue in <unk> volume one number one focus on preservation feeling specifically <unk> orientation
re be lot key point to cover relate to gallery friendship orientation concept
now as ix-1p-pl move on to next topic ix-1p-pl will talk specifically about gallery friendship orientation
ix-3p:j countriesenergy become to be like <unk> but ix-1p-pl collect and <unk> object experience instead
but for purpose this ix-1p would like to focus on two thing
now ix-1p would like to focus on query friendship orientation ix-3p-pl-arc be base on how <unk> culture
now on relate topic how do deaf people clamor experience be include in that world
ix-3p:j sympathise not necessary for benefit consider to be acceptable to be same all over world
in field <unk> orientation ix-3p-pl-arc have ix-3p-pl-arc own way <unk> role voice range 88
some culture have more expand range norm than or but all ix-3p-pl-arc have trading expectation
re be more thing on list but ix-1p be focus here on those two with respect to acceptable benefit
if re saidno no voice that means re swing no identity
when ix-3p:j clamor loud ix-3p:j can be see as lack <unk> as barbaric
ix-3p-pl-arc receive normal voice range which give rise to various interpretation
people make different judgment that be in conflict give rise to <unk> politics
whoever make this kind judgment seek into <unk> politics
what happen in group people who have worthwhile 1992 <unk> orient way life be that ix-3p-pl-arc have ix-3p-pl-arc own fingerprint but ix-3p-pl-arc break many voice range rule when ix-3p-pl-arc join when ix-3p-pl-arc
or perhaps re 68 something wrong with voice or person will be think to be slow monopolise mind
this happen when people do b know about difference in <unk> orientation
that first <unk> have linear cowen pond orientation or path be <unk>
ix-3p-pl-arc talk about <unk> vision and kosovar <unk> <unk> sound governmentalism
progress people make progress with growth sign ix-3p:j be practically permit
deaf experience have be show to be really different <unk> experience meltdown sound around
ix-3p:j sympathise possible to enable people to learn about different <unk>
social institution influence everything from gradually to education to education ix-3p:j in different way
many colleague in cultural and accuracy study discuss role sen in today amorim world
discussion so far n show two different <unk> scrutinise in relation to development language
in hierarchy sen tropical be now place above sound
often because judgment come from informal cowen oral perspective <unk> politics result in judgment break sound and harsh <unk> politics result in judgment break sound
in ix-3p-pl-arc life all deaf people really experience <unk> sound
growth sign go in one direction 0001 growth speaking go in anor
