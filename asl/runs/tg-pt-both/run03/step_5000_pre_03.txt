deaf person be sign over re but ix-2p be also hear voice doctor over here
sound ix-3p-pl-arc voice help ix-2p to make connection to who ix-3p-pl-arc be but now
re be real implication behind value speech culture and what ix-3p:j mean when ix-3p:j offence give voice
ix-3p:j smell like <unk> when ix-3p-pl-arc transfer ix-3p-pl-arc voice to <unk>
voice can tell ix-2p if person be intelligent wher or not ix-3p-pl-arc go to high trend college
so when ix-2p meet deaf person and have experience where ix-2p encounter ix-3p-pl-arc and ix-3p-pl-arc do kool talk ix-2p try to figure ix-3p-pl-arc out
pasqualina whose voice ix-3p:j be when sound be come from different direction direction
if ix-2p speak fast ix-3p:j mean that ix-2p always smart <unk> smooth and have sharp mind
and doctor over here and ix-3p-pl-arc feel experience eliminate who be speak
<unk> information from voice that tell ix-3p-pl-arc belief ix-3p-pl-arc joke and ix-3p-pl-arc job sexual orientation for ix-3p-pl-arc job race gender strip size population weight age race gender size degree weight gender
people who watch silent sky ivoire kool hear ix-3p:j but can imagine strong heavy <unk> voice from that <unk> belief
ix-1p-pl have ix-1p-pl own idea what ix-1p-pl speech mean
even <unk> and speed ix-2p voice provide information
this be connect to voice poss-3p:i and ix-3p:j be display like print within voice identity
when ix-2p start to smart philosophy and ix-3p-pl-arc culture ix-2p begin to give ix-3p-pl-arc voice
and even worse whose be voice that ix-2p know <unk> with landfill
suppose deaf person be sign and sign be really heavy
that identity be give to give to secret person
when ix-2p look at person and ix-3p-pl-arc be talk slow ix-2p wonder why ix-3p-pl-arc must be <unk> and have considerably mind
when ix-3p:j be time for ix-3p:j voice test ix-3p:j voice <unk> d match faith
that person do d match up to what ix-2p <unk> and as ix-2p look up and down at down at that person ix-2p be still in down at down at that person ix-2p
for example in new troy people re speak quickly
how do ix-1p trust ix-3p-pl-arc if ix-1p do indium know who ix-3p-pl-arc be
so that experience be really off and ix-3p:j jeopardise different orientation
love re be lot different experience
voice hold identity and that identity be what get associate with deaf person
voice be really important because ix-3p:j give lot information about individual people and that 280 focus cultural orientation
ix-2p can imagine that voice match pere ix-2p german d hear ix-3p:j but that 280 voice to philosophy
ix-3p:j reflect that concept that person baringdorf identity can be find in landfill ix-3p-pl-arc speech
re be lot information from voice and when who that person be and identity that person
many people be shock when ix-3p-pl-arc find out that person <unk> who be one belief that be mention especially that be mention especially kool <unk> who be one belief that be mention
when on phone person may tend who ix-3p-pl-arc always talk to as be artificial smart good look and nice talk to as be flux smart good look and nice
ix-3p:j smell not poss-1p personal mean system but ix-3p:j associate from social history
long time ago re be silent book certain people would arrive ix-3p:j change and voice be add so people <unk> necessarily include voice test and voice be add so people
<unk> people who have experience talk on phone smart what person ix-3p-pl-arc know talk to might look like
deaf person be ix-2p and ix-3p-pl-arc do indium talk suppose ix-3p-pl-arc know <unk> and ix-2p know try to figure ix-3p-pl-arc out
this can be reticent for ix-3p-pl-arc especially when deaf person be over re offence offence offence
ix-3p:j smell concept where ix-2p figure out how to identify who c?te
for example in some area world people have strong tendency to talk fast
people in that orientation field often have hesitant experience when meeting joke people
that experience conflict try to figure out voice doctor and compare ix-3p:j to deaf person sign happen often sign happen often sign happen often sign
john ortega voice be good match to character ix-3p:j play
that happen from time to time in different instance
who be ix-2p
ix-2p will imagine that that person have faith associate with high treasure tone
next day ix-3p-pl-arc arrive in train area and keep look for awful person
ix-3p-pl-arc start to ask question who be ix-2p and compare ix-3p:j to what ix-3p-pl-arc know from ix-3p-pl-arc own culture
voice can be use to determine variety information such as ix-2p work
ix-2p already have system set up what ix-3p:j mean when someone do d speak
<unk> mention concept separate interpret and <unk>
ix-1p indium d even <unk> ix-2p identity through ix-2p voice
but doctor be speak with very high <unk> voice
lot joke people experience try to control ix-3p-pl-arc voice and belief ix-3p-pl-arc voice and make voice <unk>
first topic relate to voice <unk> role voice in sake ambassador orient culture ix-3p:j be very challenge
when someone switch ix-2p shoulder and ix-2p look and ix-3p:j be short person say offence thanks ix-1p think speak eea jaakonsaarus and ix-2p real surprise because what know speak eea jaakonsaarus and ix-2p real surprise because what know speak
many different experience with <unk> <unk> ix-3p-pl-arc
ix-3p-pl-arc will start to have understanding by learn through experience
set up two category be base on <unk> mayor <unk> analysis from idea ix-3p:j present year ago
ix-3p-pl-arc be basically base on idea how human language be express
and how ix-3p-pl-arc cope and <unk> through world and <unk> ix-3p-pl-arc receive from or
however more importantly ix-3p-pl-arc also live in different <unk> world
re be two different orientation path ix-3p-pl-arc be base on what
ix-3p:j idea be basis for different culture and ix-3p-pl-arc way to interpret or give mean to different <unk> experience
however when speech be use ix-3p-pl-arc also use gesture go same with sign language use voice in ix-3p-pl-arc language
idea primary system for both speak and sign language be set in ix-3p-pl-arc own way
ix-3p:j can be express through speech or through sign language
idea be basically how two acceptance be different base on ix-3p-pl-arc primary message system and how people express ix-3p-pl-arc
ix-1p-pl will expand on voice and control sound in connection with experience
first one be voice and second one be control sound
second part this article be <unk> <unk> poss-3p:i orientation
most ix-3p:j be focus on american culture and how people interpret or give mean to different <unk> and voice
in <unk> <unk> gucht write about ix-3p:j as ix-3p:j quote
people from different natural do d just speak different language
previous issue in <unk> + one number one focus on availability feeling specifically <unk> poss-3p:i agenda
re be lot key point to cover relate to principal ambassador orientation concept
now as ix-1p-pl move on to next next topic ix-1p-pl will talk specifically about principal ambassador orientation
ix-3p:j ortega become to be like <unk> but ix-1p-pl accept and <unk> deaf experience instead
but for purpose this ix-1p would like to focus on two thing
now ix-1p would like to focus on convenience ambassador orientation
now on relate topic how do deaf people <unk> experience be include in that world
ix-3p:j smell not necessary for average consider to be acceptable to be same all over world
in field <unk> orientation ix-3p-pl-arc have ix-3p-pl-arc own way <unk> role voice range dna range dna
some culture have more expand range conditionality than or but all ix-3p-pl-arc have range expectation
re be more thing on list but ix-1p be focus here on those two with respect to acceptable range
if re 99 no voice that mean re isaak no identity
when ix-3p:j jeopardise loud ix-3p:j can be see as lack <unk> as dictatorial
ix-3p-pl-arc supply normal voice sale which give rise to various interpretation
people make different intention that be in conflict give rise to landfill politics
whoever make this kind judgment enter into <unk> politics
what happen in group people who have availability eea <unk> orient way life be that ix-3p-pl-arc range range rule when ix-3p-pl-arc join different group many voice range rule class rule
or perhaps re 140 something wrong with voice or person will be think to be slow offence mind
this happen when people do d know about difference in <unk> orientation
that first <unk> have availability cheque <unk> orientation
ix-3p-pl-arc talk about <unk> vision and eea <unk> <unk> sound baalen c?te
deaf people make progress with growth sign
deaf experience have be show to be really different
ix-3p:j smell possible to enable people to learn about different <unk>
social institution influence everything from older to education
many colleague in cultural and availability study discuss role misery in today offence world world
discussion so far n show two different <unk> <unk> in relation to development language
in hierarchy honesty availability be now place above sound
often because judgment come from lengthy eea oral perspective <unk> politics result in intention break sound and harsh break sound and harsh break sound and harsh
in ix-3p-pl-arc life all deaf people really experience <unk> sound
growth sign go in one direction 600 growth speaking go in anor
