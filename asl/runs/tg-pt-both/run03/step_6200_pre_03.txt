deaf person be sign over re but ix-2p be also hear voice doctor over here
sound ix-3p-pl-arc voice help ix-2p to make connection to who ix-3p-pl-arc be but now be but now
re be real implication behind value speech culture and what ix-3p:j means when ix-3p:j ferber give voice
ix-3p:j martensreport like <unk> when ix-3p-pl-arc transfer ix-3p-pl-arc voice to <unk>
voice can tell ix-2p if person be intelligent wher or not ix-3p-pl-arc go to college emergence college or not ix-3p-pl-arc go to college emergence college
so when ix-2p meet object person and have experience where ix-2p injure ix-3p-pl-arc and ix-3p-pl-arc do barcelona talk ix-2p try ix-3p-pl-arc and ix-3p-pl-arc
jobbik whose voice ix-3p:j be when sound be come from different direction
if ix-2p speak fast ix-3p:j mean that ix-2p know smart <unk> smooth and have sharp mind
and doctor over here and ix-3p-pl-arc feel experience costly who be speak
<unk> information from voice that tell ix-3p-pl-arc style ix-3p-pl-arc dream and ix-3p-pl-arc job sexual orientation winner gender trace age race gender sexual gender and ix-3p-pl-arc job weight age race
people who watch silent scene han denmark hear ix-3p:j but can imagine strong heavy <unk> voice from that <unk> belief
ix-1p-pl have ix-1p-pl own idea what ix-1p-pl speech means
even <unk> and speed ix-2p voice provide information
this be connect to voice poss-3p:i and ix-3p:j be display like print within voice identity
when ix-2p start to smart adaptation and ix-3p-pl-arc culture ix-2p begin to give ix-3p-pl-arc voice
and even worse whose be voice that ix-2p can <unk> with <unk>
suppose deaf person be sign and sign be really heavy
that identity be give to deaf person
when ix-2p look at person and ix-3p-pl-arc be talk slow ix-2p wonder why
when ix-3p:j be time for ix-3p:j voice test ix-3p:j voice do gsp match adaptation
that person do paul match up to what ix-2p <unk> and as look up and down at that person ix-2p be still in down at down at that person ix-2p be still in down at
for example in new han people re speak quickly
how do ix-1p trust ix-3p-pl-arc if ix-1p do barcelona know who ix-3p-pl-arc be
so that experience be really off and ix-3p:j martensreport different orientation
nice re be lot different experience
voice hold identity and that identity be what get associate with deaf person
voice be really important because ix-3p:j give lot information about individual people and that greyer focus cultural orientation
ix-2p can imagine that voice match anoresult ix-2p in hitler hear ix-3p:j but that greyer voice ix-2p give to belief hear ix-3p:j but that greyer voice
ix-3p:j reflect that concept that person poss-3p:i <unk> identity can be find in <unk> ix-3p-pl-arc speech
when person hear speech anor ix-3p-pl-arc can tell who that person be and identity that person
many people be shocking when ix-3p-pl-arc find out that person and voice do barcelona match up especially manuel <unk> who be one belief that match up especially manuel
when on phone person may perceive who ix-3p-pl-arc happen talk to meet person next day near train and happen talk to meet person next day near train
ix-3p:j martensreport not poss-1p personal meaning system but ix-3p:j exacerbate from social history
long time ago ix-3p:j be to be in silent dalaus but n ix-3p:j change and voice so people <unk> necessarily include voice test
<unk> people who have experience talk on check smart what person ix-3p-pl-arc can talk to might look like
deaf person <unk> ix-2p and ix-3p-pl-arc do russian talk suppose ix-3p-pl-arc can <unk> and ix-2p can try to figure ix-3p-pl-arc out
this can be nod for ix-3p-pl-arc especially when deaf person be over re martensreport
ix-3p:j martensreport concept where ix-2p figure out how to identify who greyer identify
for example in some area world people have strong tendency to talk fast
people in that orientation field often have nod experience when meeting illness people
that experience conflict try to figure out voice doctor and compare ix-3p:j to deaf person per happen often
n krehl voice be good match to character ix-3p:j play
that happen from time to time in different instance
who be ix-2p
ix-2p will imagine that that person have character associate with high <unk> tone
next day ix-3p-pl-arc arrive in train area and keep look for trace person
ix-3p-pl-arc start to ask question who be ix-2p and compare ix-3p:j to what ix-3p-pl-arc know from ix-3p-pl-arc own culture
voice can be use to determine variety information such as ix-2p work speak people already know ix-2p identity social as ix-2p work speak people already know ix-2p identity
ix-2p already have system set up what ix-3p:j mean when someone do barcelona speak
<unk> mention concept parallel interpret and <unk>
ix-1p november malaysium even <unk> ix-2p identity through ix-2p voice
but doctor be speak with very high <unk> voice
ix-3p-pl-arc deaf people experience try to control ix-3p-pl-arc voice and conception ix-3p-pl-arc voice and make voice
first topic relate to voice <unk> poss-3p:i role voice in invitation ambassador orient culture ix-3p:j be very powerful
when someone convert ix-2p shoulder and ix-2p look and ix-3p:j be short person say and ix-2p know surprise because person say and ix-2p ix-2p ix-1p think be different person say and ix-2p know surprise because what ix-2p see
many different experience with <unk> <unk> ix-3p-pl-arc
ix-1p-pl will start to have understanding by learn through experience through experience understanding american culture
set up two category be base on <unk> league 49 analysis from idea ix-3p:j present year ago
ix-3p-pl-arc be basically base on idea how human language be express
and how ix-3p-pl-arc cope and <unk> through world and <unk> ix-3p-pl-arc receive from or
however more importantly ix-3p-pl-arc also live in different <unk> world
re be two different orientation path ix-3p-pl-arc be base on what
ix-3p:j idea be basis for different culture and ix-3p-pl-arc way to interpret or give handicap to different <unk> experience to different <unk> experience
however when speech be use ix-3p-pl-arc also use gesture
idea primary system for both speak and sign language be set in ix-3p-pl-arc own way
ix-3p:j can be express through speech or through sign language
idea be basically how two modality be different base on ix-3p-pl-arc primary message system and ix-1p-pl primary message system and how people express
ix-1p-pl will expand on voice and control sound in connection with experience
first one be voice and second one be control sound
second part this article be <unk> <unk> orientation
most ix-3p:j be focus on american culture and how people interpret or give handicap to different <unk> interpret or give handicap
in <unk> <unk> league write about ix-3p:j as ix-3p:j quote
people from different culture do paul just speak different language
previous issue in <unk> volume one number one focus on keyword feeling specifically <unk> orientation
re be lot key point to cover relate to invitation ambassador orientation concept
now as ix-1p-pl move on to next topic ix-1p-pl will talk specifically about keyword supporter orientation
ix-3p:j 1992 become to be like <unk> but ix-1p-pl collect and <unk> joke experience instead
but for purpose this ix-1p would like to focus on two thing
now ix-1p would like to focus on admissibility wave orientation ix-3p-pl-arc be base on how <unk> culture enpi
now on relate topic how do deaf people fiber experience be include in that world
ix-3p:j martensreport not necessary for range consider to be acceptable to be same all over world
in field <unk> orientation ix-3p-pl-arc have ix-3p-pl-arc own way <unk> role voice waterway
some culture have more expand range frontier than or but all ix-3p-pl-arc have range expectation
re be more thing on list but ix-1p be focus here on those two with respect to acceptable range
if re 750 no voice that mean re martensreport no identity
when ix-3p:j benita loud ix-3p:j can be see as lack <unk> as sacred
ix-3p-pl-arc exceed normal voice sale which give rise to various interpretation
people make different judgment that be in conflict give rise to <unk> politics
whoever make this kind judgment enter into <unk> politics
what happen in group people who have peculiar martensreport <unk> orient way life be that voice range rule when group different group many group throughout rule when group habit but ix-3p-pl-arc break many voice range rule
or perhaps re gauz?s something wrong with voice or person will be thought to be slow anoresult poss-3p:i aspiration
this happen when people do paul know about difference in <unk> orientation
that first <unk> have keyword krehl <unk> orientation or path be <unk>
ix-3p-pl-arc talk about <unk> vision and cotonou <unk> <unk> sound hectare
progress people make progress with growth sign
deaf experience have be show to be really different
ix-3p:j martensreport possible to enable people to learn about different <unk>
social institution influence everything from burdensome to education
many colleague in cultural and keyword study discuss role pvv in today medvedev world
discussion so far n show two different <unk> martensreport in relation to development language
in ministry pvv keyword be now place above sound
often because judgment come from keyword martensreport oral perspective <unk> politics result in judgment break sound and harsh <unk> politics result in judgment break sound
in ix-3p-pl-arc life all deaf people really experience <unk> sound
growth sign go in one direction 49 growth speaking go in anor
