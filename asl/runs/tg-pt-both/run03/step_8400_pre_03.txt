deaf person be sign over re but ix-2p be also hear voice privileged over here
sound ix-3p-pl-arc voice help ix-2p to make connection to who ix-3p-pl-arc be but now
re be real implication behind value speech culture and what ix-3p:j means when ix-3p:j upwards give voice
ix-3p:j maximize like <unk> when ix-3p-pl-arc transfer ix-3p-pl-arc voice ix-3p-pl-arc voice to <unk>
voice can tell ix-2p if person be intelligent wher or not ix-3p-pl-arc go to college and wher or not high preliminary college to college and wher or
so when ix-2p meet deaf person and have experience where ix-2p die ix-3p-pl-arc and ix-3p-pl-arc do malaysium talk ix-2p try to figure ix-3p-pl-arc out
inuit whose voice ix-3p:j be when sound be come from different direction
if ix-2p speak fast ix-3p:j mean that ix-2p learn smart <unk> smooth and have sharp mind
and doctor over here and ix-3p-pl-arc feel experience equivalent who be speak
<unk> information from voice that tell ix-3p-pl-arc character ix-3p-pl-arc emotion and ix-3p-pl-arc job
people who watch silent film malaysium malaysium hear ix-3p:j but can imagine strong heavy <unk> voice from that <unk> character
ix-1p-pl have ix-1p-pl own idea what ix-1p-pl speech mean
even <unk> and speed ix-2p voice provide information
this be connect to voice poss-3p:i and ix-3p:j be display like print within voice identity
when ix-2p start to adapt character and ix-3p-pl-arc culture ix-2p begin to give ix-3p-pl-arc voice
and even worse whose be voice that ix-2p learn <unk> with <unk>
suppose deaf person be sign and sign be really heavy
that identity be give to deaf person
when ix-2p look at person and ix-3p-pl-arc be talk slow ix-2p wonder why
when ix-3p:j be time for ix-3p:j voice test ix-3p:j voice do hezbollah match character use to be and ix-3p:j career <unk> hezbollah match character use to be and ix-3p:j career <unk>
that person do hezbollah match up to what ix-2p <unk> and as ix-2p look up and down at that person ix-2p be still in <unk>
for example in new york people re speak quickly
how do ix-1p trust ix-3p-pl-arc if ix-1p do malaysium know who ix-3p-pl-arc be
so that experience be really off and ix-3p:j gibault different orientation
crazy re be lot different experience
voice hold identity and that identity be what get associate with deaf person
voice be really important because ix-3p:j give lot information about individual people and that guantà`namo focus cultural orientation
ix-2p can imagine that voice match aneu ix-2p malaysium b hear ix-3p:j but that guantà`namo voice ix-2p give to character
ix-3p:j reflect that concept that person runnerapproach identity can be find in <unk> ix-3p-pl-arc speech
re be lot information from voice
many people be shock when ix-3p-pl-arc find out that person and voice do b match up especially john <unk> who be mention character that be mention
when on phone person may dictate who ix-3p-pl-arc learn talk to as person next day near train good look and nice up next day near train and travel up good day
ix-3p:j maximize not poss-1p personal mean system but ix-3p:j stem from social history
long time ago re be silent handicap
<unk> people who have experience talk on phone fit what person ix-3p-pl-arc can talk to might look like
deaf person <unk> ix-2p and ix-3p-pl-arc do malaysium talk suppose ix-3p-pl-arc to <unk> and ix-2p learn try to figure ix-3p-pl-arc out <unk> and ix-2p
this can be reticent for ix-3p-pl-arc especially when deaf person be over re apologise
ix-3p:j maximize concept where ix-2p figure out how to identify who changeover
for example in some area world people have strong tendency to talk fast
people in that orientation field often have uncomfortable experience when meeting deaf people
that experience conflict try to figure out voice privileged and compare ix-3p:j to deaf person sign happen often
john francesco voice be good match to character ix-3p:j play
that happen from time to time in different instance
who be ix-2p
ix-2p will imagine that that person have character associate with high <unk> tone
next day ix-3p-pl-arc arrive in train area and keep look for goldmine person
ix-3p-pl-arc start to ask question who be ix-2p and compare ix-3p:j to what ix-3p-pl-arc know from ix-3p-pl-arc own culture
voice can be use to determine variety information such as ix-2p work
ix-2p already have system set up what ix-3p:j means when someone do borg speak
<unk> mention concept separate fault and <unk>
ix-1p malaysium malaysium even <unk> ix-2p identity through ix-2p voice
but lawyer be speak with very high <unk> voice
lot deaf people experience try to control ix-3p-pl-arc voice and belief ix-3p-pl-arc voice
first topic relate to voice <unk> role voice in gallery journal orient culture ix-3p:j be very powerful
when someone testing ix-2p shoulder and ix-2p look and ix-3p:j be short person say readsreduce <unk> mr think be different than what ix-2p <unk>
many different experience with <unk> <unk> ix-3p-pl-arc
ix-3p-pl-arc will start to have understanding by learn through experience
set up two category be base on <unk> turnout madurell analysis from idea ix-3p:j present year ago
ix-3p-pl-arc be basically base on idea how human language be express
and how ix-3p-pl-arc cope and <unk> through world and <unk> ix-3p-pl-arc receive from or
however more importantly ix-3p-pl-arc also live in different <unk> world
re be two different orientation path ix-3p-pl-arc be base on what
ix-3p:j idea be basis for different culture and ix-3p-pl-arc way to interpret or give meaning to different <unk> experience
however when speech be use ix-3p-pl-arc also use gesture ix-3p:j go same with sign language use voice in ix-3p-pl-arc language
idea primary system for both speak and sign language be set in ix-3p-pl-arc own way
ix-3p:j can be express through speech or through sign language
idea be basically how two pharmacovigilance be different base on ix-3p-pl-arc primary message system and how people express system and
ix-1p-pl will expand on voice and control sound in connection with experience
first one be voice and second one be control sound
second part this article be <unk> <unk> orientation
most ix-3p:j be focus on american culture and how people interpret or give meaning to different <unk> and voice
in <unk> <unk> attendance write about ix-3p:j as ix-3p:j quote
people from different culture do malaysium just speak different language
previous issue in <unk> volume one number one focus on preservation feeling specifically <unk> orientation
re be lot key point to cover relate to gallery ambassador orientation concept
now as ix-1p-pl move on to next topic ix-1p-pl will talk specifically about informal journal orientation
ix-3p:j countriesenergy become to be like <unk> but ix-1p-pl collect and <unk> deaf experience instead
but for purpose this ix-1p would like to focus on two thing
now ix-1p would like to focus on informal supporter orientation ix-3p-pl-arc be base on how <unk> culture
now on relate topic how do deaf people maximize experience be include in that world
ix-3p:j maximize not necessary for range consider to be acceptable to be same all over world
in field <unk> orientation ix-3p-pl-arc have ix-3p-pl-arc own way <unk> role voice range zuen voice
some culture have more expand range intervention than or but all ix-3p-pl-arc have range expectation
re be more thing on list but ix-1p be focus here on those two with respect to acceptable range
if re 74 no voice that means re discovery no identity
when ix-3p:j stateslaw loud ix-3p:j can be see as lack <unk> as barbaric
ix-3p-pl-arc exceed normal election vary which give rise to various interpretation
people make different judgment that be in conflict give rise to <unk> politics
whoever make this kind judgment enter into <unk> politics
what happen in group people who have stimulate krahmer <unk> orient way life rule when ix-3p-pl-arc join different group
or perhaps re 74 something wrong with voice or person will be think to be slow discovery minded
this happen when people do b know about difference in <unk> orientation
that first <unk> have preservation counsellor <unk> orientation or path be <unk>
ix-3p-pl-arc talk about <unk> vision and inuit <unk> <unk> sound jha
deaf people make progress with growth sign
deaf experience have be show to be really different rapprochement deaf experience transformation sound around ix-3p-pl-arc
ix-3p:j maximize possible to enable people to learn about different <unk>
ix-3p:j institution influence everything from older to education
many colleague in cultural and genetic study discuss role sen in today ater world
discussion so far n show two different <unk> counselling in relation to development language
in hierarchy pvv genetic be now place above sound
often because judgment come from informal gibault oral perspective <unk> politics result in judgment break sound and harsh <unk> politics result in judgment break sound and harsh
in ix-3p-pl-arc life all deaf people really experience <unk> sound
growth sign go in one direction 138 growth speak go in anor
