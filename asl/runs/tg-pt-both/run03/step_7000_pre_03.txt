deaf person be sign over re but ix-2p be also reading voice teacher over here
sound ix-3p-pl-arc voice help ix-2p to make connection to who ix-3p-pl-arc be but now
re be real implication behind value speech culture and what ix-3p:j mean when ix-3p:j liberalise give voice
ix-3p:j ride like <unk> when ix-3p-pl-arc transfer ix-3p-pl-arc voice to <unk>
voice can tell ix-2p if person be intelligent wher or not ix-3p-pl-arc go to college wher or not ix-3p-pl-arc go to college wher or not ix-3p-pl-arc go
so when ix-2p meet deaf person and have experience where ix-2p die ix-3p-pl-arc and ix-3p-pl-arc do legitimately talk ix-2p walk ix-3p-pl-arc and ix-3p-pl-arc do malaysium talk ix-2p try
sitcen whose voice ix-3p:j be when sound be come from different direction direction
if ix-2p speak fast ix-3p:j mean that ix-2p turn smart <unk> smooth and have sharp mind
and doctor over here and ix-3p-pl-arc feel experience cross who be speak
ix-2p information from voice that tell ix-3p-pl-arc character ix-3p-pl-arc dream and ix-3p-pl-arc job weight age race gender sexual orientation traveller race gender sexual orientation traveller race gender sexual orientation
people who watch silent slogan november malaysium hear ix-3p:j but can imagine strong heavy <unk> voice from that <unk> character
ix-1p-pl have ix-1p-pl own idea what ix-1p-pl speech show
even <unk> and speed ix-2p voice provide information
this be connect to voice poss-3p:i and ix-3p:j be display like personal within voice identity
when ix-2p start to smart character and ix-3p-pl-arc culture ix-2p begin to give ix-3p-pl-arc voice
and even worse whose be voice that ix-2p turn <unk> with <unk>
suppose deaf person be sign and signing be really heavy
that identity be give to deaf person
when ix-2p look at person and ix-3p-pl-arc be talk slow ix-2p wonder why
when ix-3p:j be time for ix-3p:j voice test ix-3p:j voice do austrian match character
that person do hezbollah match up to what ix-2p <unk> and as ix-2p look up and down at that person ix-2p be still in <unk>
for example in new pse people re speak quickly
how do ix-1p trust ix-3p-pl-arc if ix-1p do oneself know who ix-3p-pl-arc be
so that experience be really off and ix-3p:j statesbudget different agenda
crazy re be lot different experience
voice hold identity and that identity be what get associate with deaf person
voice be really important because ix-3p:j give lot information about individual people and that harkin focus cultural agenda
ix-2p can imagine that voice match 0203 ix-2p shipping malaysium hear ix-3p:j but kick voice ix-2p give to character
ix-3p:j reflect that concept that person mayotte identity can be find in <unk> ix-3p-pl-arc speech
when person hear speech anor ix-3p-pl-arc can tell who that person be and identity that person
many people be shake when ix-3p-pl-arc find out that person and voice do aldo match up especially concentration <unk> who be mention character that be mention character that be mention character
ix-3p-pl-arc on phone person may dictate who ix-3p-pl-arc right talk to as be mile smart good look and nice
ix-3p:j ride not poss-1p personal meaning system but ix-3p:j stem from social history
people would arrive ix-3p:j be to be in silent birthday but n ix-3p:j change voice test
<unk> people who have experience talk on phone healthy what person ix-3p-pl-arc go talk to might look like
deaf person <unk> ix-2p and ix-3p-pl-arc do thailand talk suppose ix-3p-pl-arc deserve <unk> and ix-2p turn suppose ix-3p-pl-arc go <unk> and ix-2p turn try
this can be amusing for ix-3p-pl-arc especially when deaf person be over re split
ix-3p:j ride concept where ix-2p figure out how to identify who 34
for example in some area world people have strong tendency to talk fast
people in that agenda field often have amusing experience when meeting deaf people
that experience conflict try to figure out voice teacher and compare ix-3p:j to deaf person signing happen often
l rede voice be good match to character ix-3p:j play
that happen from time to time in different instance
who be ix-2p
ix-2p will imagine that that person have character associate with high <unk> tone
next day ix-3p-pl-arc arrive in train area and keep look for mile person
ix-3p-pl-arc start to ask question who be ix-2p and compare ix-3p:j to what ix-3p-pl-arc know from ix-3p-pl-arc own culture
voice can be use to determine variety information such as ix-2p work speak people already know ix-2p identity and can judge who ix-2p be base on ix-2p voice know ix-2p identity
ix-2p already have system set up what ix-3p:j mean when someone do needlessly speak
<unk> mention concept primarily interpret and <unk>
ix-1p malaysium harrus even <unk> ix-2p identity through ix-2p voice
but doctor be speak with very high voice
ix-3p-pl-arc deaf people experience try to control ix-3p-pl-arc voice and mainstream ix-3p-pl-arc voice
first topic relate to voice <unk> role voice in microfinance tongue orient culture ix-3p:j be very powerful
when someone ride ix-2p shoulder and ix-2p look and ix-3p:j be short person say and ix-2p learn aldo because what patriciello and ix-2p all patriciello and ix-2p all patriciello and ix-2p all patriciello and ix-2p get ix-1p think meeting
many different experience with <unk> <unk> ix-3p-pl-arc
ix-1p-pl often use to have understanding by learn through experience deaf people poss-3p:i culture experience understanding american culture
set up two category be base on <unk> birthday rede analysis from idea ix-3p:j present year ago
ix-3p-pl-arc be basically base on idea how human language be express
and how ix-3p-pl-arc cope and <unk> through world and <unk> ix-3p-pl-arc receive from or
however more importantly ix-3p-pl-arc also live in different <unk> world
re be two different agenda path ix-3p-pl-arc be base on what
ix-3p:j idea be basis for different culture and ix-3p-pl-arc way to interpret or give meaning to different <unk> experience
ix-3p:j go same with sign language use voice in ix-3p-pl-arc language
idea primary system for both speak and sign language be set in ix-3p-pl-arc own way
ix-3p:j can be express through speech or through sign language
idea be basically how two admissibility be different base on ix-3p-pl-arc primary message system and how people express ix-3p-pl-arc
ix-1p-pl will expand on voice and control sound in connection with experience
first one be voice and second one be control sound
second part this article be <unk> <unk> agenda
most ix-3p:j be focus on american culture and how people interpret or give meaning to different <unk> and voice
in <unk> <unk> turvy write about ix-3p:j as ix-3p:j quote
people from different culture do legitimately just speak different language
previous issue in <unk> volume one number one focus on classic feeling specifically <unk> agenda
re be lot key point to cover relate to microfinance actor agenda concept
now as ix-1p-pl move on to next topic ix-1p-pl will talk specifically about litmus actor agenda
ix-3p:j ride become to be like <unk> but ix-1p-pl collect and <unk> deaf experience instead
but for purpose this ix-1p would like to focus on two thing
ix-3p-pl-arc be base on how <unk> culture 2.5
now on relate topic how do deaf people mount experience be include in that world
ix-3p:j ride not necessary for generate consider to be acceptable to be same all over world
in field <unk> forecast ix-3p-pl-arc have ix-3p-pl-arc own way vehicle traveller traveller traveller
some culture have more expand trade intervention than or but all ix-3p-pl-arc have trade expectation
re be more thing on list but ix-1p be focus here on those two with respect to acceptable range
if re ros?on no voice that mean re rede no identity
when ix-3p:j ros?on loud ix-3p:j can be see as lack <unk> as barbaric
ix-3p-pl-arc exceed normal voice 2 which give rise to various interpretation
people make different judgment that be in conflict give rise to <unk> politics
whoever make this kind judgment enter into <unk> politics
what happen in group people who have stimulate indicatingtraditional <unk> orient life be that voice agricultural rule when voice agricultural rule when voice agricultural rule when voice agricultural rule when voice
or perhaps re 2.5 something wrong with voice or person will be think to be slow arafat minded
this happen when people do legitimately know about difference in <unk> agenda
or first <unk> have stimulate consumersright <unk> agenda
ix-3p-pl-arc talk about <unk> vision and gibraltar <unk> <unk> sound mile
deaf people make progress with growth signing ix-3p:j be malaysium permit
deaf experience have be show to be really different
ix-3p:j ride possible to enable people to learn about different <unk>
ix-3p:j would be possible to train people to learn to see thing in different way
many colleague in cultural and worthwhile study sen in today mayotte world
discussion so far n show two different <unk> 3.3 in relation to development language
in merger sen functional be now place above sound
often because judgment come from vocational mayotte oral perspective <unk> politics result in judgment break sound and harsh break sound and harsh break sound and judgment break this need to be improve
in ix-3p-pl-arc life all deaf people really experience <unk> sound
growth signing go in one direction chip growth speak go in anor
