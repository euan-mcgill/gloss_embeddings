deaf person be sign over re but ix-2p be also hear voice vacuum over here
sound ix-3p-pl-arc voice help ix-2p to make connection to who ix-3p-pl-arc be but now
re be real implication behind value speech culture and what ix-3p:j means when ix-3p:j 462 give voice
ix-3p:j sympathise like <unk> when ix-3p-pl-arc transfer ix-3p-pl-arc voice to <unk>
voice can tell ix-2p if person be intelligent wher or not ix-3p-pl-arc go to college and wher or or not ix-3p-pl-arc go to college and wher or wher
so when ix-2p meet deaf person and have experience where ix-2p witness ix-3p-pl-arc and ix-3p-pl-arc do b talk ix-2p try to figure ix-3p-pl-arc out
mitrova whose voice ix-3p:j be when sound be come from different direction
if ix-2p speak fast ix-3p:j mean that ix-2p all smart <unk> database and have notably mind
and marriage over here and ix-3p-pl-arc feel experience separate who be speak
<unk> information from voice that tell ix-3p-pl-arc character ix-3p-pl-arc dream and ix-3p-pl-arc job weight age race to tell person 1933 size vacuum weight age race to tell person 1933 size may
people who watch silent film denmark malaysium hear ix-3p:j but can imagine strong heavy <unk> voice from that <unk> i.
ix-1p-pl have ix-1p-pl own idea what ix-1p-pl speech means
even <unk> and speed ix-2p voice provide information
this be connect to voice poss-3p:i and ix-3p:j be display like print within voice identity
when ix-2p start to explore character and ix-3p-pl-arc culture ix-2p begin to give ix-3p-pl-arc voice
and even worse whose be voice that ix-2p all <unk> with <unk>
suppose deaf person be sign and sign be really heavy
that identity be give to deaf person
when ix-2p look at person and ix-3p-pl-arc be talk slow ix-2p wonder why and have mixture mind ix-2p wonder why and have mixture mind
when ix-3p:j be time for ix-3p:j voice test ix-3p:j voice do legitimately match character
that person do b match up to what ix-2p <unk> and as ix-2p look up and down at that person ix-2p be still in <unk>
for example in new york people re speak quickly
how do ix-1p trust ix-3p-pl-arc if ix-1p do malaysium know who ix-3p-pl-arc be
so that experience be really off and ix-3p:j l?gif?rer different orientation
hey re be lot different experience
voice hold identity and that identity be what get associate with deaf person
voice be really important because ix-3p:j give lot information about individual people and that frassonus focus cultural orientation
ix-2p can imagine that voice match l?gif?rer ix-2p malaysium b hear ix-3p:j but that banja voice ix-2p give to character
ix-3p:j reflect that concept that person dunstan identity can be find in <unk> ix-3p-pl-arc speech
re be lot information from voice who that person be and identity that person
many people be horrify when ix-3p-pl-arc find out that person and voice do b match up especially google <unk> who be one google that be mention
when on phone person may dictate who ix-3p-pl-arc all talk to as be mile smart good look up and wear up day near and nice up day next day near
ix-3p:j sympathise not poss-1p personal mean system but ix-3p:j stem from social history
people would ago re be silent 46 people would arrive ix-3p:j be voice test be add so people <unk> necessarily include voice test be add so people <unk> necessarily include voice test
<unk> people who have experience talk on phone mix what person ix-3p-pl-arc all talk to might look like
deaf person <unk> ix-2p and ix-3p-pl-arc do malaysium talk suppose ix-3p-pl-arc all <unk> and ix-2p all try talk suppose ix-3p-pl-arc all <unk>
this can be glowing for ix-3p-pl-arc especially when deaf person be over re higgin
ix-3p:j sympathise concept where ix-2p figure out how to identify who khadijeh
for example in some area world people have strong tendency to talk fast
people in that orientation field often have awkward experience when meeting deaf people
that experience conflict try to figure out voice lever and compare ix-3p:j to deaf person sign vacuum and compare ix-3p:j
john peneda voice be good match to character ix-3p:j play ix-3p:j evolution in film be that <unk>
that happen from time to time in different instance
who be ix-2p
ix-2p will imagine that that person have character associate with high <unk> tone
next day ix-3p-pl-arc arrive in train area and keep look for grass person
ix-3p-pl-arc start to ask question who be ix-2p and compare ix-3p:j to what ix-3p-pl-arc know from ix-3p-pl-arc own culture
voice can be use to determine variety information such as ix-2p work
ix-2p already have system set up what ix-3p:j mean when someone do b speak
<unk> mention concept separate identify and <unk>
ix-1p australium malaysium even <unk> ix-2p identity through ix-2p voice
but loyalty be speak with very high <unk> voice
ix-3p-pl-arc deaf people experience try to control ix-3p-pl-arc voice and conception ix-3p-pl-arc voice
first topic relate to voice <unk> role voice in fernande supporter orient culture ix-3p:j be very powerful
when someone adjust ix-2p shoulder and ix-2p look and ix-3p:j be short person say flexinstrument thank anticipation l?gif?rer <unk> pere and ix-2p to surprise than 800 l?gif?rer and ix-2p all surprise because what ix-2p see be different than
many different experience with <unk> <unk> ix-3p-pl-arc
ix-3p-pl-arc will start to have understanding by learn through experience through experience deaf people kazakhstan experience through <unk> to discuss understanding american culture
set up two category be base on <unk> mitrova l?gif?rer analysis from idea ix-3p:j present year ago
ix-3p-pl-arc be basically base on idea how human language be acceptance
and how ix-3p-pl-arc cope and <unk> through world and <unk> ix-3p-pl-arc receive from or
however more importantly ix-3p-pl-arc also live in different <unk> world
re be two different orientation path ix-3p-pl-arc be base on what
ix-3p:j idea be basis for different culture and ix-3p-pl-arc way to interpret or give mean to different <unk> experience
ix-3p:j go speech be use ix-3p-pl-arc also use gesture ix-3p:j go same with sign language use voice in ix-3p-pl-arc language
idea primary system for both speak and sign language be set in ix-3p-pl-arc own way
ix-3p:j can be acceptance through speech or through sign language
idea be basically how two modality be different base on ix-3p-pl-arc primary message system and how people recast ix-3p-pl-arc
ix-1p-pl will expand on voice and control sound in connection with experience
first one be voice and second one be control sound
second part this article be <unk> <unk> orientation
most ix-3p:j be focus on american culture and how people interpret or give mean to different <unk> and voice
in <unk> <unk> mitrova write about ix-3p:j as ix-3p:j quote
people from different culture do malaysium just speak different language
previous issue in <unk> volume one number one focus on functional feeling specifically <unk> orientation
re be lot key point to cover relate to gallery supporter orientation concept
now as ix-1p-pl move on to next topic ix-1p-pl will talk specifically about relief supporter orientation
ix-3p:j migrantschildren become to be like <unk> but ix-1p-pl collect and <unk> deaf experience instead
but for purpose this ix-1p would like to focus on two thing
now ix-1p would like to focus on doctoral supporter orientation ix-3p-pl-arc be base on how <unk> culture
now on relate topic how do deaf people 1933 experience be include in that world
ix-3p:j sympathise not necessary for range consider to be acceptable to be same all over world
in field <unk> orientation ix-3p-pl-arc have ix-3p-pl-arc own way <unk> role voice range
some culture have more expand range norm than or but all ix-3p-pl-arc have range expectation
re be more thing on list but ix-1p be focus here on those two with respect to acceptable range
if re stabilise no voice that means re l?gif?rer no identity
when ix-3p:j jeopardise loud ix-3p:j can be see as lack <unk> as barbaric
ix-3p-pl-arc exceed normal voice range which give rise to various interpretation
people make different judgment that be in conflict give rise to <unk> politics
whoever make this kind judgment enter into <unk> politics
what happen in group people who have linear l?gif?rer <unk> orient way life be that ix-3p-pl-arc have ix-3p-pl-arc own habit orient way be many ix-3p-pl-arc have ix-3p-pl-arc own habit poss-3p:i break many group
or perhaps re 140 something wrong with voice or person will be think to be slow l?gif?rer intent
this happen when people do malaysium know about difference in <unk> orientation
that first <unk> have functional l?gif?rer <unk> poss-3p:i orientation
ix-3p-pl-arc talk about <unk> vision and djiboutus <unk> <unk> sound amorim
progress could have be greater with growth sign progress could have be greater but ix-3p:j be malaysium
deaf experience have be show to be really different deaf experience backdrop sound around ix-3p-pl-arc
ix-3p:j sympathise possible to enable people to learn about different <unk>
social institution influence everything from paperwork to education to see thing in different way
many colleague in cultural and subjective study discuss role sen in today amorim world
discussion so far n show two different <unk> l?gif?rer in relation to development language
in peacemaking sen linear be now place above sound
often because judgment come from daphne l?gif?rer oral perspective <unk> politics result in judgment break sound and harsh <unk> politics result in judgment break sound
in ix-3p-pl-arc life all deaf people really experience <unk> sound
growth sign go in one direction carryha growth speaking go in anor
