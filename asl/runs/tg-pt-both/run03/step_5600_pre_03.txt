deaf person be sign over re but ix-2p be also hearing voice doctor over here
sound ix-3p-pl-arc voice help ix-2p to make connection to who ix-3p-pl-arc be but now
re be real implication behind value speech culture and what ix-3p:j means when ix-3p:j lagendijk give voice
ix-3p:j & like <unk> when ix-3p-pl-arc power ix-3p-pl-arc voice to <unk>
voice can tell ix-2p if person be intelligent wher or not ix-3p-pl-arc go to high preliminary college
so when ix-2p meet deaf person and have experience where ix-2p encounter ix-3p-pl-arc and ix-3p-pl-arc do abortion talk ix-2p try to figure ix-3p-pl-arc out
o whose voice ix-3p:j be when sound be come from different direction voice ix-3p:j be when sound be come
if ix-2p speak fast ix-3p:j means that ix-2p know smart <unk> tight and have notably mind
and doctor over here and ix-3p-pl-arc feel experience calculate who be speak
<unk> information from voice that tell ix-3p-pl-arc character ix-3p-pl-arc personality and ix-3p-pl-arc job
people who watch silent story richard d hear ix-3p:j but can imagine strong heavy <unk> voice from that <unk> character
ix-1p-pl have ix-1p-pl own idea what ix-1p-pl speech means
even <unk> and speed ix-2p voice provide information
this be connect to voice poss-3p:i and ix-3p:j be armenia like print within voice
when ix-2p start to smart character and ix-3p-pl-arc culture ix-2p begin to give ix-3p-pl-arc voice
and even worse whose be voice that ix-2p know <unk> with <unk>
suppose deaf person be sign and sign be really heavy
that identity be give to deaf person
when ix-2p look at person and ix-3p-pl-arc be talk slow ix-2p wonder why
when ix-3p:j be time for ix-3p:j voice test ix-3p:j voice do d match character <unk> ix-3p-pl-arc use to be and ix-3p:j career <unk>
that person do d match up to what ix-2p <unk> and as ix-2p look up and down at that person ix-2p be still in down at that person ix-2p be still in down at that person ix-2p be still in down at that person ix-2p
for example in new york people re speak quickly
how do ix-1p trust ix-3p-pl-arc if ix-1p do plainly know who ix-3p-pl-arc be
so that experience be really off and ix-3p:j & different orientation
crazy re be lot different experience
voice suspend identity and that identity be what get associate with deaf person
voice be really important because ix-3p:j give lot information about individual people and that ageing focus cultural orientation
ix-2p can imagine that voice match ageing ix-2p denmark d hear ix-3p:j but that ageing voice ix-2p give to character
ix-3p:j reflect that concept that person liechtenstein identity can be find in <unk> ix-3p-pl-arc speech
re be lot information from voice
many people be shocking when ix-3p-pl-arc find out that person and voice do d match up especially rome <unk> who be one character that be mention
when on screen person may imagination who ix-3p-pl-arc turn talk to as be navel smart good look and nice
ix-3p:j & not poss-1p personal meaning system but ix-3p:j illustrate from social history
long time ago re be silent pocket <unk> but n ix-3p:j change and voice be add so people <unk> necessarily include voice test
<unk> people who have experience talk on screen fit what person ix-3p-pl-arc learn talk to might look like
deaf person <unk> ix-2p and ix-3p-pl-arc do plainly talk suppose ix-3p-pl-arc stand <unk> and ix-2p know try to figure ix-3p-pl-arc out
this can be annoyed for ix-3p-pl-arc especially when deaf person be over re poss-3p:i lagendijk
ix-3p:j & concept where ix-2p figure out how to identify who centralise
for example in some area world people have strong tendency to talk fast
people in that orientation field often have silly experience when meeting unusual people
that experience conflict try to figure out voice doctor and compare ix-3p:j to deaf person per happen often
john <unk> voice be good match to character ix-3p:j play
that happen from time to time in different instance
who be ix-2p
ix-2p will imagine that that person have character associate with high <unk> disappointing
next day ix-3p-pl-arc arrive in train area and keep look for awful person
ix-3p-pl-arc start to ask question who be ix-2p and compare ix-3p:j to what ix-3p-pl-arc know from ix-3p-pl-arc own culture
voice can be use to determine variety information such as ix-2p work
ix-2p already have system set up what ix-3p:j means when someone do d speak
<unk> mention concept biggest interpret and <unk>
ix-1p uk gsp even <unk> ix-2p identity through ix-2p voice
but doctor be speak with very high <unk> voice
lot deaf people experience try to control ix-3p-pl-arc voice and motto ix-3p-pl-arc voice to make voice <unk>
first topic relate to voice <unk> role voice in horizon ambassador orient culture ix-3p:j be very powerful
when someone screen ix-2p tear and ix-2p look and ix-3p:j be short person poss-3p:i <unk> and ix-2p go surprise because what ix-2p see be different person what ix-2p <unk> be different than what ix-2p <unk>
many different experience with <unk> <unk> ix-3p-pl-arc
ix-3p-pl-arc will start to have understanding by learn through experience
set up two category be base on <unk> turnout <unk> analysis from idea ix-3p:j present year ago
ix-3p-pl-arc be basically base on idea how human language be express
and how ix-3p-pl-arc cope and <unk> through world and <unk> ix-3p-pl-arc receive from or
however more importantly ix-3p-pl-arc also live in different <unk> world
re be two different orientation path ix-3p-pl-arc be base on what
ix-3p:j idea be basis for different culture and ix-3p-pl-arc way to interpret or give means to different <unk> experience
however when speech be use ix-3p-pl-arc also use gesture
idea primary system for both speak and sign language be set in ix-3p-pl-arc own way
ix-3p:j can be express through speech or through sign language
idea be basically how two substantive be different base on ix-3p-pl-arc primary message system and how people express ix-3p-pl-arc
ix-1p-pl will expand on voice and control sound in connection with experience
first one be voice and second one be control sound
second part this article be <unk> <unk> orientation
most ix-3p:j be focus on american culture and how people interpret or give means to different <unk> and voice
in <unk> <unk> attendance write about ix-3p:j as ix-3p:j quote
people from different culture do d just speak different language
previous issue in <unk> volume one number one focus on attainable feeling specifically <unk> orientation
re be lot key point to cover relate to screen campaigner orientation concept
now as ix-1p-pl move on to next topic ix-1p-pl will talk specifically about danish ovation orientation
testimony as well
but for purpose this ix-1p would like to focus on two thing
now ix-1p would like to focus ambassador orientation
now on relate topic how do deaf people permanently experience be include in that world
ix-3p:j & not necessary for average consider to be acceptable to be same all over world
in field <unk> orientation ix-3p-pl-arc have ix-3p-pl-arc own way <unk> role voice gas ageing
some culture have more expand stock norm than or but all ix-3p-pl-arc have range expectation
and noise gas re be more thing on list but ix-1p be focus here on those two with respect to those two with respect to those two with respect to those two with respect to those two with respect to those two with respect to those two with respect to those two with respect to those two with respect to those two with respect to those two with respect to those two with respect to those two with respect to those two with respect to those two with respect to those two with respect to those two with respect to those two with respect to those two with respect to those two with respect to those two with respect to those two with respect to those two with respect to those two with respect to those two with respect to those two with respect to those two with respect to those two with respect to those two with respect to those two with respect to those two with respect to those two with respect to those two with respect to those two with respect to those two with respect to those two with respect to those two with respect to those two with respect to those two with respect to those two with respect to those two with respect to those two with respect to those two with respect to those two with respect to those two with respect to those two with respect to those two with respect to
if re endeavor no voice that means re 40 no identity
when ix-3p:j petre loud ix-3p:j can be see as lack <unk> as unjust
ix-3p-pl-arc exceed normal voice feature which give rise to various interpretation
people make different judgment that be in conflict give rise to <unk> politics
whoever make this kind judgment enter into to politics
what happen in group people who have optimal arena orient orient way life be that group basics but ix-3p-pl-arc break different group class but ix-3p-pl-arc break different group class but ix-3p-pl-arc join different group
or perhaps re lagendijk something wrong with voice or person will be think to be slow cheque minded
this happen when people do russian know about difference in <unk> orientation
that first cancel have oretical cheque <unk> orientation
ix-3p-pl-arc talk about <unk> vision and liberalise <unk> <unk> sound <unk>
deaf people make progress with growth sign
deaf experience have be show to be really different
ix-3p:j & possible to enable people to learn about different <unk>
social institution influence everything from older to education
many colleague in cultural and oretical study discuss role sen in today centralise world
discussion so far n show two different <unk> <unk> in relation to development language
in principal sen creativity be now place above sound
often because judgment come from screen lagendijk oral perspective <unk> politics result in judgment break sound and harsh <unk> politics result in judgment
in ix-3p-pl-arc life all deaf people really experience <unk> sound
growth sign go in one direction lagendijk growth speak go in anor
