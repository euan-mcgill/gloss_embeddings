deaf person be sign over re but ix-2p be also hearing voice doctor over here
sound ix-3p-pl-arc voice help ix-2p to make connection to who ix-3p-pl-arc be but now
re be real implication behind value speech culture and what ix-3p:j mean when ix-3p:j acquire give voice
ix-3p:j wurtz like to when ix-3p-pl-arc transfer ix-3p-pl-arc voice to <unk>
voice can tell ix-2p if person be intelligent wher or not ix-3p-pl-arc go to college and wher or not ix-3p-pl-arc go to high spotlight college
so when ix-2p meet popular person and have experience where ix-2p encounter ix-3p-pl-arc and ix-3p-pl-arc do b talk ix-2p try to figure ix-3p-pl-arc
w whose voice ix-3p:j be when sound be come from different direction voice ix-3p:j
if ix-2p speak fast ix-3p:j mean that ix-2p can smart <unk> smooth and have sharp mind
and doctor over here and ix-3p-pl-arc feel experience wide who be speak
<unk> information from voice that tell ix-3p-pl-arc character ix-3p-pl-arc personality and ix-3p-pl-arc job sexual orientation waldner stauner size pace weight age race gender sexual orientation waldner stauner size pace weight age race
people who watch silent story australium denmark hear ix-3p:j but can imagine strong heavy <unk> voice from that <unk> character
ix-1p-pl have ix-1p-pl own idea what ix-1p-pl speech mean
even <unk> and speed ix-2p voice provide information
this be connect to voice poss-3p:i and ix-3p:j be display like print within voice identity
when ix-2p start to shape character and ix-3p-pl-arc culture ix-2p begin to give ix-3p-pl-arc voice
and even worse whose be voice that ix-2p can <unk> with <unk>
suppose deaf person be sign and sign be really heavy
that identity be give to deaf person
when ix-2p look at person and ix-3p-pl-arc be talk slow ix-2p wonder why
when ix-3p:j be time for ix-3p:j voice test ix-3p:j voice do en match character
that person do somehow match up to what ix-2p <unk> and as ix-2p look up and <unk>
for example in new han people re speak quickly
how do ix-1p trust ix-3p-pl-arc if ix-1p do slave know who ix-3p-pl-arc be
so that experience be really off and ix-3p:j pere different orientation
crazy re be lot different experienced
voice hold identity and that identity be what get associate with deaf person
voice be really important because ix-3p:j give lot information about individual people and that saharan focus cultural orientation
ix-2p can imagine that voice match 0203 ix-2p australium german hear ix-3p:j but that 45 voice ix-2p give to character
ix-3p:j reflect that concept that people characterise identity can be find in <unk> ix-3p-pl-arc speech
re be lot information from voice
many people be shock when ix-3p-pl-arc find out that person and voice do australium match up especially john <unk> who be mention character that be mention
when on phone person may perceive who ix-3p-pl-arc can talk to as be trap smart good look and nice
ix-3p:j wurtz not poss-1p personal meaning system but ix-3p:j stem from social history
long time ago re be to be in silent weight but n ix-3p:j change and voice be add so people but n ix-3p:j change and voice be add so people <unk>
<unk> people who have experience talk on phone connect what person ix-3p-pl-arc learn talk to might look like
deaf person <unk> ix-2p and ix-3p-pl-arc do en talk suppose ix-3p-pl-arc can <unk> and ix-2p can slave talk hell ix-3p-pl-arc can <unk> and ix-2p
this can be noteworthy for ix-3p-pl-arc especially when deaf person be over re statesbudget when
ix-3p:j wurtz concept where ix-2p figure out how to identify who -rrb-
for example in some area world people have strong tendency to talk fast
people in that orientation field often have awkward experience when meeting deaf people
that experience conflict try to figure out voice doctor and compare ix-3p:j to deaf person sign happen often
ashton -lrb- voice be good match to character ix-3p:j play
that happen from time to time in different instance
who be ix-2p
ix-2p will imagine that that person have character associate with high <unk> spotlight
next day ix-3p-pl-arc arrive in train area and keep look for rock person
ix-3p-pl-arc start to ask question who be ix-2p and compare ix-3p:j to what ix-3p-pl-arc know from ix-3p-pl-arc own culture
voice can be use to determine variety information such as ix-2p work
ix-2p already have system set up what ix-3p:j mean when someone do plainly speak
<unk> mention concept parallel define and <unk>
ix-1p australium kool even <unk> ix-2p identity through ix-2p voice
but doctor be speak with very high <unk> voice
ix-3p-pl-arc deaf people experience try to control ix-3p-pl-arc voice and belief ix-3p-pl-arc voice and make voice <unk>
first topic relate to voice <unk> role voice in principal supporter orient culture ix-3p:j be very powerful
when someone convert ix-2p shoulder and ix-2p look and ix-3p:j be short person say ix-1p thank ix-1p think be different than what because can surprise because what ix-2p see be different than what ix-2p <unk>
many different experience with <unk> <unk> ix-3p-pl-arc
ix-3p-pl-arc will start to have understanding by learn through experience
set up two category be base on <unk> dose pascual analysis from idea ix-3p:j present year ago
ix-3p-pl-arc be basically base on idea how human language be express
and how ix-3p-pl-arc cope and <unk> through world and <unk> ix-3p-pl-arc receive from or
however more importantly ix-3p-pl-arc also live in different <unk> world
re be two different orientation path ix-3p-pl-arc be base on what
ix-3p:j idea be basis for different culture and ix-3p-pl-arc way to interpret or give meaning to different <unk> experienced
however when speech be use ix-3p-pl-arc also use appeal
idea primary system for both speak and sign language be set in ix-3p-pl-arc own way
ix-3p:j can be express through speech or through sign language
idea be basically how two modality be different base on ix-3p-pl-arc primary message system and how people express ix-3p-pl-arc
ix-1p-pl will expand on voice and control sound in connection with experience
first one be voice and second one be control sound
second part this article be <unk> <unk> orientation
most ix-3p:j be focus on american culture and ix-1p-pl people interpret or give meaning to different <unk> and voice
in <unk> <unk> lace write about ix-3p:j as ix-3p:j quote
people from different culture do paul just speak different language
previous issue in <unk> volume one number one focus on classic feeling specifically <unk> orientation
re be lot key point to cover relate to gallery ovation orientation concept
now as ix-1p-pl move on to next topic ix-1p-pl will talk specifically about principal supporter orientation
ix-3p:j kro become to be like <unk> but ix-1p-pl collect and <unk> popular experience instead
but for purpose this ix-1p would like to focus on two thing
now ix-1p would like to focus on query supporter orientation
now on relate topic how do deaf people 74 experience be include in that world
ix-3p:j wurtz not necessary for range consider to be acceptable to be same all over world
in field <unk> poss-3p:i orientation ix-3p-pl-arc have ix-3p-pl-arc own way <unk> voice agricultural saberus
some culture have more expand agricultural norm than or but all ix-3p-pl-arc have agricultural expectation
re be more thing on list but ix-1p be focus here on those two with respect to acceptable range
if re wurtz no voice that mean re pere no identity
when ix-3p:j inaugurate educate ix-3p:j can be see as lack <unk> as immoral
ix-3p-pl-arc exceed normal voice per which give rise to various interpretation
people make different judgment that be in conflict give rise to <unk> politics
whoever make this kind judgment enter into <unk> politics
what happen in group people who have stimulate pere <unk> orient way life be that ix-3p-pl-arc have ix-3p-pl-arc own hurry but ix-3p-pl-arc break many voice agricultural rule when group
or perhaps re -rrb- something wrong with voice or person will be think to be slow pere minded
this happen when people do paul know about difference in <unk> orientation
or first <unk> have keyword cheque <unk> poss-3p:i mobility
ix-3p-pl-arc talk about <unk> vision and athisaarus <unk> <unk> sound kro
deaf people make progress with growth sign
deaf experience have be show to be really different
ix-3p:j wurtz possible to enable people to learn about different <unk>
social institution influence everything from inhumane to education
many colleague in cultural and typical study discuss role sen in today pere world
discussion so far n show two different <unk> 42 in relation to development language
in merger sen keyword keyword be now place above sound
often because judgment come from principal 02 oral perspective <unk> politics result in judgment break sound and harsh break this can to be improve
in ix-3p-pl-arc life all deaf people really experience <unk> sound
growth sign go in one direction -rrb- growth speaking go in anor
