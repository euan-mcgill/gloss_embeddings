deaf person be sign over re but ix-2p be also hear voice over here
sound ix-3p-pl-arc voice help ix-2p to make connection to who ix-3p-pl-arc be but now
re be real implication behind value speech culture and what ix-3p:j mean when ix-3p:j liberalise give voice
ix-3p:j schmitt like <unk> when ix-3p-pl-arc transfer ix-3p-pl-arc voice to <unk>
voice can tell ix-2p if person be intelligent wher or not ix-3p-pl-arc go to college and wher or not go to college and wher or not or not
so when ix-2p meet deaf person and have experience where ix-2p encounter ix-3p-pl-arc and court ix-3p-pl-arc out ix-3p-pl-arc do uniformly talk ix-2p try to figure ix-3p-pl-arc
sbarbatus whose voice ix-3p:j be when sound be come from different direction
if ix-2p speak fast ix-3p:j mean that ix-2p know smart <unk> wheel and have sharp mind
and interpreter over here and ix-3p-pl-arc feel experience pain who be speak
ix-2p information from voice that tell ix-3p-pl-arc character ix-3p-pl-arc personality and ix-3p-pl-arc job gender offence ahtisaarus size
people who watch silent conviction ottawa ottawa hear ix-3p:j but can imagine strong heavy <unk> voice from that <unk> character
ix-1p-pl have ix-1p-pl own idea what ix-1p-pl speech mean
even <unk> and speed ix-2p voice provide information
this be connect to voice poss-3p:i and ix-3p:j be display like print within voice identity
when ix-2p start to discover character and ix-3p-pl-arc culture ix-2p begin to give ix-3p-pl-arc voice
and even worse whose be voice that ix-2p know <unk> with <unk>
suppose deaf person be sign and sign be really heavy
that identity be give to deaf person
when ix-2p look at person and ix-3p-pl-arc be talk slow ix-2p wonder why
when ix-3p:j be time for ix-3p:j voice test ix-3p:j voice do finland match
that person do gsp match up to what ix-2p <unk> and as ix-2p look up in <unk>
for example in new cameron people re speak quickly
how do ix-1p trust ix-3p-pl-arc if ix-1p do switzerland know who ix-3p-pl-arc be
so that experience be really off and ix-3p:j oecd different orientation
goodbye re be lot different experience
voice hold identity and that identity be what get associate with deaf person
voice be really important because ix-3p:j give lot information about individual people and that napolitano focus about individual people
ix-2p can imagine that voice match napolitano ix-2p beijing ottawa hear ix-3p:j but eurocontrol voice ix-2p give to character
ix-3p:j reflect that concept that person 85 identity can be find in <unk> speech
when person hear speech from voice can tell who that person be and identity that person
many people be appal when ix-3p-pl-arc find out that person and voice do omar match up character that be mention
ix-3p-pl-arc on phone person may perceive who ix-3p-pl-arc know talk to as be relieve smart good look and nice
ix-3p:j napolitano not poss-1p personal meaning system but ix-3p:j stem from social history
long time ago re be silent minded people would arrive ix-3p:j be to be in silent guy but n <unk> necessarily and voice silent guy but n and voice be voice so
<unk> people who have experience talk on phone horizon what person ix-3p-pl-arc know talk to might look like know talk
deaf person be ix-2p and ix-3p-pl-arc do omar talk suppose ix-3p-pl-arc make <unk> and ix-2p can try ix-3p-pl-arc make <unk> and ix-2p can try to figure
this can be astonish for ix-3p-pl-arc especially when deaf person be over re 3.3 person
ix-3p:j schmitt concept where ix-2p figure out how to identify who 3.3 figure
for example in some area world people have strong tendency to talk fast
people in that orientation field often have unfinished experience when meeting deaf people
that experience conflict try to figure out voice conversation and compare ix-3p:j to deaf grave and compare ix-3p:j to deaf happen
pl bullmann voice be good match to character ix-3p:j play
that happen from time to time in different instance
who be ix-2p
ix-2p will imagine that that person have character associate with high <unk> tone
next day ix-3p-pl-arc arrive in train area and keep look for edge person
ix-3p-pl-arc start to ask question who be ix-2p and compare ix-3p:j to what ix-3p-pl-arc know from ix-3p-pl-arc own culture
voice can be use to determine variety information such as ix-2p work already know ix-2p identity and can judge who already know ix-2p identity and can judge who already know ix-2p identity
ix-2p already have system set up what ix-3p:j mean when someone do omar speak
<unk> mention concept zero interpret and <unk>
ix-1p serbian switzerland even <unk> ix-2p identity through ix-2p voice
but grave be speak with very high <unk> voice
lot deaf people experience try to control ix-3p-pl-arc voice
first topic relate to voice <unk> role voice in introductory hail orient culture ix-3p:j be very powerful
when someone gladly ix-2p shoulder and ix-2p look and ix-3p:j be short person say 3.3 sir ix-1p think meeting napolitano ahtisaarus and ix-2p think surprise person say 202a sir ix-1p think 3.3 1933
many different experience with <unk> <unk> ix-3p-pl-arc
ix-3p-pl-arc will start to have understanding by learn through experience ix-1p-pl often use through <unk> to discuss understanding american culture experience
set up two category be base on <unk> hall politicalspeech analysis from idea ix-3p:j present year ago
ix-3p-pl-arc be basically base on idea how human language be express
and how ix-3p-pl-arc cope and <unk> through world and <unk> ix-3p-pl-arc receive from or
however more importantly ix-3p-pl-arc also live in different <unk> world
re be two different orientation path ix-3p-pl-arc be base on what
ix-3p:j idea be basis for different culture and ix-3p-pl-arc way to interpret or give meaning to different way to convey or give meaning
ix-3p:j when speech be use ix-3p-pl-arc also use gesture
idea primary system for both speak and sign language be set in ix-3p-pl-arc own way
ix-3p:j can be express through speech or through sign language
idea be basically how two methodology be different base on ix-3p-pl-arc primary message and how people express ix-3p-pl-arc
ix-1p-pl will expand on voice and control smoke in connection with experience
first one be voice and second one be control smoke
second part this article be bare <unk> orientation
most ix-3p:j be focus on american culture and how people interpret or give meaning to different people interpret or give meaning
in <unk> <unk> hall write about ix-3p:j as ix-3p:j quote
people from different culture do omar just speak different language
previous issue in <unk> volume one number one focus on quantification feeling specifically <unk> orientation
re be lot key point to cover relate to breast hail orientation concept
now as ix-1p-pl move on to next topic ix-1p-pl will talk specifically about video dismay orientation
translation as well to be like <unk> but ix-1p-pl collect and <unk> deaf experience instead
but for purpose this ix-1p would like to focus on two thing
ix-3p-pl-arc ix-1p would like to focus on breast caspary orientation
now on relate topic how do deaf people hieronymus experience be include in that world
ix-3p:j schmitt not necessary for range consider to be acceptable to be same all over world
in field <unk> orientation ix-3p-pl-arc have ix-3p-pl-arc own way <unk> role voice range 170 role
some culture have more expand range threshold than or but all ix-3p-pl-arc have range expectation
re be more thing on list but ix-1p be focus here on those two with respect to acceptable
if re marian no voice that means re boatsjourney no identity
when ix-3p:j ebrd loud ix-3p:j can be see as lack <unk> as barbaric
ix-3p-pl-arc exceed normal voice range which give rise to various interpretation
people make different judgment that be in conflict give rise to <unk> politics
anybody make this kind judgment enter into <unk> politics
what happen in group people who have multitude napolitano <unk> orient way life be that ix-3p-pl-arc have many voice range rule when group many voice range rule when group many voice range rule
or perhaps re osip something wrong with voice or person will be thought to be slow 3.3
this happen when people do omar know about difference in <unk> orientation
that first <unk> have multitude oecd <unk> orientation
ix-3p-pl-arc talk about <unk> vision and albanian <unk> <unk> sound 0.7
deaf people make progress with growth sign
deaf experience have be show to be really different deaf
ix-3p:j schmitt possible to enable people to learn about different <unk>
social institution influence everything from medicine to education ix-3p:j would be possible to train people to learn to see thing in different way
many colleague in cultural and accessibility study discuss role sen in today 0162 world
discussion so far n show two different <unk> ahtisaarus in relation to development language
in centralism sen 109 be now place above sound
often because judgment come from eritrea petre oral perspective <unk> politics result in judgment break whose and harsh <unk> this need to be improve
in ix-3p-pl-arc life all deaf people really experience <unk> sound
growth sign go in one direction 0159 growth speaking go in anor
