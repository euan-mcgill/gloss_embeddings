deaf person be sign over re but ix-2p be also hear voice interpreter over here
sound ix-3p-pl-arc voice help ix-2p to make connection to who ix-3p-pl-arc be but now
re be real implication behind value speech culture and what ix-3p:j mean when ix-3p:j hospitalise give voice ix-3p:j statesbalance
ix-3p:j tatarellum like ix-3p:j when ix-3p-pl-arc transfer ix-3p-pl-arc voice to ecb
voice can tell ix-2p if person be intelligent wher or not or not ix-3p-pl-arc go to high atomic college
so when ix-2p meet deaf person and have experience where ix-2p encounter ix-3p-pl-arc and figure ix-3p-pl-arc out
mrl whose voice ix-3p:j be when sound be come from different direction
if ix-2p speak fast ix-3p:j mean that ix-2p need smart explosive smooth and have sharp mind
and questioner over here and ix-3p-pl-arc feel experience device who be speak
ict information from voice that tell ix-3p-pl-arc character ix-3p-pl-arc talent and ix-3p-pl-arc job gender traveller gender sexual pattern sexual gender sexual
people who watch silent film dioxide t hear ix-3p:j but can imagine strong heavy <unk> voice from that ix-3p:j character
ix-1p-pl have ix-1p-pl own idea what ix-1p-pl speech mean
even <unk> and speed ix-2p voice provide information
this be connect to voice poss-3p:i and ix-3p:j be display like print within voice identity
when ix-2p start to shape character and ix-3p-pl-arc culture ix-2p begin to give ix-3p-pl-arc voice
and even worse whose be voice that ix-2p need explosive with detect
suppose deaf person be sign and signing be really heavy
that identity be give to deaf person
when ix-2p look at person and ix-3p-pl-arc be talk slow ix-2p wonder why and have tactical
when ix-3p:j be time for ix-3p:j voice test ix-3p:j voice do malta match character
that person do logically match up to what ix-2p <unk> and as ix-2p look up in <unk>
for example in new york people re speak quickly
how do ix-1p trust ix-3p-pl-arc if ix-1p do malta know who ix-3p-pl-arc be
so that experience be really off and ix-3p:j decentralisation different orientation
guess re be lot different experience
voice hold identity and that identity be what get associate with deaf person
voice be really important because ix-3p:j give lot information about individual people and that traveller focus cultural orientation
ix-2p can imagine that voice match 51 ix-2p mann japanese hear to character ix-3p:j but that efta voice ix-2p give to character
ix-3p:j reflect that concept that person 51 identity can be find in polarise ix-3p-pl-arc speech
when person hear speech anor ix-3p-pl-arc can tell who that person be and identity that person
many people be shock when ix-3p-pl-arc find out that person and voice do malta match up especially john scanner who be one character that be mention
when on phone person may perceive who ix-3p-pl-arc need and nice ix-3p-pl-arc agree to meet person next day ix-3p-pl-arc agree to meet person next day ix-3p-pl-arc agree to meet person
ix-3p:j tatarellum not poss-1p personal meaning system but ix-3p:j stem from social history
long time ago re be silent band
ict people who have experience talk on phone compete what person ix-3p-pl-arc need talk to might look like person talk to might look like
deaf person that ix-2p and ix-3p-pl-arc do barcelona talk suppose ix-3p-pl-arc know explosive and ix-2p need suppose ix-3p-pl-arc know tag and ix-2p need
this can be unsettled for ix-3p-pl-arc especially when deaf person be over re 51
ix-3p:j tatarellum concept where ix-2p figure out how to identify who javier
for example in some area world people have strong tendency to talk fast
people in that orientation field often have unfinished experience when meeting deaf people
that experience conflict try to figure out voice doctor and compare ix-3p:j to deaf person sign happen often
ix-3p:j tatarellum voice be good match to character ix-3p:j play ix-3p:j character be that <unk>
that happen from time to time in different number
who be ix-2p
ix-2p will imagine that that person have character associate with high ix-1p-pl tone
next day ix-3p-pl-arc arrive in train area and keep look for warmer person
ix-3p-pl-arc start to ask question who be ix-2p and compare ix-3p:j to what ix-3p-pl-arc know from ix-3p-pl-arc own culture
voice can be use to determine variety information such as ix-2p work from moment ix-2p and can judge already know ix-2p identity and can judge already know ix-2p identity
ix-2p already have system set up what ix-3p:j mean when someone do altoger speak
ict mention concept separate interpret and <unk>
ix-1p mann switzerland even speculate ix-2p identity through ix-2p voice
but questioner be speak with very high <unk> voice
lot deaf people experience try to control ix-3p-pl-arc voice and conception ix-3p-pl-arc voice
first topic relate to voice scanner role voice in introductory recruitment orient culture ix-3p:j be very powerful
when someone pack ix-2p shoulder and ix-2p look and ix-3p:j be short person say 0212 quote ix-1p maybe meeting 1.2 0212 and ix-2p need surprise because what ix-2p see be different than surprise because what
many different experience with wife <unk> ix-3p-pl-arc
ix-3p-pl-arc will start to have understanding by learn through experience ix-1p-pl often people fan american culture
set up two category be base on <unk> hall daystime analysis from idea ix-3p:j present year ago
ix-3p-pl-arc be basically base on idea how human language be express
and how ix-3p-pl-arc cope and speculate through world and nigerium ix-3p-pl-arc receive from or
however more importantly ix-3p-pl-arc also live in different <unk> world
re be two different orientation path ix-3p-pl-arc be base on what
ix-3p:j idea be basis for different culture and ix-3p-pl-arc way to interpret or give meaning to different domain experience
ix-3p:j when speech be use ix-3p-pl-arc also use gesture
idea primary system for both speak and sign language be set in ix-3p-pl-arc own way
ix-3p:j can be express through speech or through sign language
idea be basically how two modality be different base on ix-3p-pl-arc primary message system and how people express ix-3p-pl-arc
ix-1p-pl will expand on voice and control sound in connection with experience
first one be voice and second one be control sound
second part this article be ruin rob orientation
most ix-3p:j be focus on american culture and how people interpret or give meaning to different people and voice
in <unk> cormorant ante write about ix-3p:j as ix-3p:j quote
people from different culture do tamil just speak different language
previous issue in jo volume one number one focus on 10.30 feeling specifically <unk> orientation
re be lot key point to cover relate to greet lecture orientation concept
now as ix-1p-pl move on to next topic ix-1p-pl will talk specifically about greet lecture orientation
m mrl become to be like <unk> but ix-1p-pl collect and polarise deaf experience instead
but for purpose this ix-1p would like to focus on two thing
now ix-1p would like to focus on breast dima orientation ix-3p-pl-arc
now on relate topic how do deaf people semitism experience be include in that world
ix-3p:j tatarellum not necessary for range consider to be acceptable to be same all over world
in field cormorant orientation ix-3p-pl-arc have ix-3p-pl-arc own way truth role voice range 05 range 05
some culture have more expand range norm than or but all ix-3p-pl-arc have range expectation
re be more thing on list but ix-1p be focus here on those two with respect to acceptable range
if re rossa no voice that mean re mauritius no identity
when ix-3p:j danuta loud ix-3p:j can be see as lack constraint as barbaric
ix-3p-pl-arc exceed normal voice vary which give rise to various interpretation
people make different judgment that be in conflict give rise to polarise politics
whoever make this kind judgment enter into <unk> politics
what happen in group people who have multitude broadcaster <unk> orient way but ix-3p-pl-arc break many voice many group be that ix-3p-pl-arc have ix-3p-pl-arc own habit but ix-3p-pl-arc break many voice
or perhaps re rossa something wrong with voice or person will be think to be slow elephant minded
this happen when people do hezbollah know about difference in nigerium orientation
that first <unk> have conceptual 51 <unk> orientation
ix-3p-pl-arc talk about horn vision and mast <unk> <unk> sound holder
progress people make progress with growth sign progress could have be greater but ix-3p:j be altoger permit
deaf experience have be show to be really different deaf sound around ix-3p-pl-arc
ix-3p:j tatarellum possible to enable people to learn about different religion
social institution influence everything from medicine to education ix-3p:j would be possible to train people to learn to see thing in different way
many colleague in cultural and myriad study present role sen in today 51 world
discussion so far n show two different <unk> uyttebroeck in relation to development language
in hierarchy thrust oenological be now place above sound
often because judgment come from sample 51 oral perspective tag politics result this need to be improve
in ix-3p-pl-arc life all deaf people really experience have sound
growth signing go in one direction berec growth speaking go in anor
