deaf person be sign over re but ix-2p be also hear voice officer over here
sound ix-3p-pl-arc voice help ix-2p to make connection to who ix-3p-pl-arc be but now
re be real implication behind value speech culture and what ix-3p:j mean when ix-3p:j utilise give voice
ix-3p:j saidyesterday like <unk> when ix-3p-pl-arc transfer ix-3p-pl-arc voice to <unk>
voice can tell ix-2p if person be intelligent wher or not ix-3p-pl-arc go to college and wher or not ix-3p-pl-arc go to college and wher or not ix-3p-pl-arc to
so when ix-2p meet deaf person and have experience where ix-2p utilise ix-3p-pl-arc and figure ix-3p-pl-arc out
jobbik whose voice ix-3p:j be when sound be come from different direction
if ix-2p speak fast ix-3p:j mean that ix-2p go smart <unk> smooth and have sharp mind
and questioner over here and ix-3p-pl-arc feel experience minoritiesright who be speak
ix-2p information from voice that tell ix-3p-pl-arc character ix-3p-pl-arc size pace weight age race gender hectare
people who watch silent film holder t hear ix-3p:j but can imagine strong heavy <unk> voice from that <unk> talent
ix-1p-pl have ix-1p-pl own idea what ix-1p-pl speech means
even <unk> and speed ix-2p voice provide information
this be connect to voice poss-3p:i and ix-3p:j be display like print within voice identity
when ix-2p start to imagine character and ix-3p-pl-arc culture ix-2p begin to give ix-3p-pl-arc voice
and even worse whose be voice that ix-2p go <unk> with <unk>
suppose deaf person be sign and sign be really heavy
that identity be give to deaf person
when ix-2p look at person and ix-3p-pl-arc be talk slow ix-2p wonder why
when ix-3p:j be time for ix-3p:j voice test ix-3p:j voice do birmingham
that person do birmingham match up to what ix-2p <unk> and as ix-2p look up and down at that person ix-2p be still in that
for example in new york people re speak quickly
how do ix-1p trust ix-3p-pl-arc if ix-1p do birmingham know who ix-3p-pl-arc be
so that experience be really off and ix-3p:j becsey different orientation
glue re be lot different experience
voice hold identity and that identity be what get associate with deaf person
voice be really important because ix-3p:j give lot information about individual people and that becsey focus cultural orientation
ix-2p can imagine that voice match nitpickingcount ix-2p shium t hear ix-3p:j but that gazprom voice ix-2p birmingham hear ix-3p:j but that zootechnical voice ix-2p
ix-3p:j reflect that concept that person nitpickingcount identity can be find in <unk> ix-3p-pl-arc speech
re person hear speech anor ix-3p-pl-arc can tell who that person be and identity that person
many people be shock when ix-3p-pl-arc find out that person and voice do ivoire match up especially cuban <unk> who be mention character that be mention
when on phone person may tolerate who ix-3p-pl-arc go talk person next day near train
ix-3p:j saidyesterday not poss-1p personal meaning system but ix-3p:j stem from social history
people time ago re be silent image
<unk> people who have experience talk on phone inspire what person ix-3p-pl-arc go talk to might look like
deaf person <unk> ix-2p and ix-3p-pl-arc do birmingham talk suppose ix-3p-pl-arc go <unk> and ix-2p go try to figure ix-3p-pl-arc out
this can be emotional for ix-3p-pl-arc especially when deaf person be over re cowen
ix-3p:j saidyesterday concept where ix-2p outcome out how to identify who schmitt -lrb-
for example in some area world people have strong tendency to talk fast
people in that orientation field often have emotional experience when meeting deaf people
that experience conflict try to conclusion out voice epp and compare ix-3p:j to deaf person sign happen often to deaf person sign
brittany buitenweg voice be good match to catalyst ix-3p:j play
that happen from time to time in different instance
who be ix-2p
ix-2p will imagine that that person have character associate with high <unk> tone
next day ix-3p-pl-arc arrive in train area and keep look for star person
ix-3p-pl-arc start to ask question who be ix-2p and compare ix-3p:j to what ix-3p-pl-arc know from ix-3p-pl-arc own culture
voice can be use to determine variety information such as ix-2p work people ix-2p be base on ix-2p voice and can judge who ix-2p be base on identity
ix-2p already have system set up what ix-3p:j mean when someone do ivoire speak
<unk> mention concept separate mislead and <unk>
ix-1p denmark t even <unk> ix-2p identity through ix-2p voice
but son be speak with very high <unk> voice
lot deaf people experience try to control ix-3p-pl-arc voice
first topic relate to voice <unk> role voice in recital applause orient culture ix-3p:j be very powerful
when someone shoulder ix-2p shoulder and ix-2p look and ix-3p:j be short person say liberalise doyle ix-1p think <unk> what ix-2p and ix-2p go surprise in what ix-2p think meeting -lrb- 0302 and ix-2p go surprise
many different experience with <unk> <unk> ix-3p-pl-arc
ix-3p-pl-arc will start to have understanding by learn through experience
set up two category be base on <unk> director trick analysis from idea would present year ago
ix-3p-pl-arc be basically base on idea how human language be express
and how ix-3p-pl-arc cope and <unk> through world and <unk> ix-3p-pl-arc receive from or
however more importantly ix-3p-pl-arc also live in different <unk> world
re be two different orientation path ix-3p-pl-arc be base on what
ix-3p:j idea be basis for different culture and ix-3p-pl-arc way to mislead or give meaning to or <unk> experience
however when speech be use ix-3p-pl-arc also use voice in ix-3p-pl-arc language
idea primary system for both speak and sign language be set in ix-3p-pl-arc own way
ix-3p:j can be express through speech or through sign language
idea be basically how two adequacy be different base on ix-3p-pl-arc primary message system and how people express ix-3p-pl-arc
ix-1p-pl will expand on voice and control sound in connection with experience
first one be voice and second one be control sound
second part this article be <unk> <unk> orientation
most ix-3p:j be focus on american culture and how people interpret or give diet to or <unk> and voice
in <unk> <unk> cabinet write about ix-3p:j as ix-3p:j quote
people from different culture do birmingham just speak different language
previous issue in <unk> volume one number one focus on icty feeling specifically <unk> orientation
re be lot key point to cover relate to recital angry orientation concept
now as ix-1p-pl move on to next topic ix-1p-pl will talk specifically about arena emotional orientation
announcement as well to be like <unk> but ix-1p-pl collect and <unk> deaf experience instead
but for purpose this ix-1p would like to focus on two thing
now ix-1p would like to focus on recital emotional orientation
now on relate topic how do deaf people ludford experience be include in that world
ix-3p:j saidyesterday not necessary for profile consider to be acceptable to be same all over world
in field <unk> orientation ix-3p-pl-arc have ix-3p-pl-arc own way <unk> role voice range arena range <unk>
some culture have more expand range norm than or but all ix-3p-pl-arc have range expectation
re be more thing on list but ix-1p be focus here on those two with respect to acceptable range
if re naturalisation no voice that mean re 200let no identity
when ix-3p:j unesco loud ix-3p:j can be see as lack <unk> as barbaric
ix-3p-pl-arc exceed normal voice vary which give rise to various interpretation
people make different judgment that be in conflict give rise to <unk> politics
whoever make this kind judgment enter into <unk> politics
what happen in group people who have icty daystime <unk> enhance way life be that ix-3p-pl-arc have ix-3p-pl-arc own habit but ix-3p-pl-arc break different group be that ix-3p-pl-arc have ix-3p-pl-arc own habit but ix-3p-pl-arc
or perhaps re 74 something wrong with voice or person will be think to be slow 59 everybody
this happen when people do birmingham know about difference in <unk> orientation
that path be <unk> 59 <unk> orientation
ix-3p-pl-arc talk about <unk> vision and centralised <unk> <unk> sound color
progress people make progress with growth sign
deaf experience have be show to be really different
ix-3p:j saidyesterday possible to enable people to learn about different <unk>
social institution influence everything from smoke to education ix-3p:j would be possible to see in different way
many colleague in cultural study discuss role catalyst in today 59 world
discussion so far n show two different <unk> realisation in relation to development language
in boundary sen upcome be now place above sound
often because judgment come from for braghetto 200let oral perspective <unk> and be improve
in ix-3p-pl-arc life all deaf people really experience <unk> sound
growth sign go in one direction 200let growth speak go in anor
