deaf person be consult over re but ix-2p be also hear voice over here
sound ix-3p-pl-arc voice help ix-2p to make connection to who ix-3p-pl-arc be but now
re be real implication behind value speech culture and what ix-3p:j mean when ix-3p:j technician give voice
ix-3p:j siwiec like scanner when ix-3p-pl-arc transfer ix-3p-pl-arc voice to <unk>
voice can tell ix-2p if person be intelligent wher or not ix-3p-pl-arc go to college and wher or bankrupt and wher or not or go to high wages college
so when ix-2p meet deaf person and have experience where ix-2p stand ix-3p-pl-arc and figure ix-3p-pl-arc altoger talk ix-2p try to have experience altoger try altoger
efrag whose voice ix-3p:j be when sound be come from different direction
if ix-2p speak fast ix-3p:j mean that ix-2p ix-2p smart <unk> smooth and have sixth mind
and interpreter over here and ix-3p-pl-arc feel experience eyeprocedure who be speak
ix-2p information from voice that tell ix-3p-pl-arc character ix-3p-pl-arc personality and ix-3p-pl-arc job gender sexual gender sexual orientation
people who watch silent film harrus jan hear ix-3p:j but can imagine strong heavy <unk> voice from that <unk> readiness
ix-1p-pl have ix-1p-pl own idea what ix-1p-pl speech means
even <unk> and speed ix-2p voice provide information
this be connect to voice poss-3p:i and ix-3p:j be display like print within voice identity
when ix-2p start to mix character and ix-3p-pl-arc culture ix-2p begin to give ix-3p-pl-arc voice ix-2p begin
and even worse whose be voice that ix-2p know <unk> with <unk>
suppose deaf person be sign and signing be really heavy
that identity be give to deaf person
when ix-2p look at person and ix-3p-pl-arc be talk slow ix-2p wonder why
when ix-3p:j be time for ix-3p:j voice test ix-3p:j voice do altoger match
that person do altoger match up to what ix-2p <unk> and as ix-2p look up in <unk> look up in <unk> look ix-2p in <unk>
for example in new york people re speak quickly
how do ix-1p trust ix-3p-pl-arc if ix-1p do finland know who ix-3p-pl-arc be
so that experience be really off and ix-3p:j decentralisation different orientation
perhaps re be lot different experience
voice hold identity and that identity be what get associate with deaf person
voice be really important because ix-3p:j give lot information about individual people and that stabiliser focus cultural orientation cultural orientation cultural orientation cultural orientation cultural orientation cultural orientation cultural orientation cultural orientation cultural orientation cultural orientation cultural orientation cultural orientation cultural orientation cultural orientation cultural orientation cultural orientation cultural orientation cultural orientation cultural orientation cultural orientation cultural orientation cultural orientation cultural orientation cultural orientation cultural orientation cultural orientation cultural orientation cultural orientation cultural orientation cultural orientation cultural orientation cultural orientation cultural orientation cultural orientation cultural orientation cultural orientation cultural orientation cultural orientation cultural orientation cultural orientation cultural orientation cultural orientation cultural orientation cultural orientation cultural orientation cultural orientation cultural orientation cultural orientation cultural orientation cultural orientation cultural orientation cultural orientation cultural orientation cultural orientation cultural orientation cultural orientation cultural orientation cultural orientation cultural orientation cultural orientation cultural orientation cultural orientation cultural orientation cultural orientation cultural orientation cultural orientation cultural orientation cultural orientation cultural orientation cultural orientation cultural orientation cultural orientation cultural orientation cultural orientation cultural orientation cultural orientation cultural orientation cultural orientation cultural orientation cultural orientation cultural orientation cultural orientation cultural orientation cultural orientation cultural orientation cultural orientation cultural orientation cultural orientation cultural orientation cultural orientation cultural orientation cultural orientation cultural orientation cultural orientation cultural orientation cultural orientation cultural orientation cultural orientation cultural orientation cultural orientation cultural orientation cultural orientation cultural orientation cultural orientation cultural orientation cultural orientation cultural orientation cultural orientation cultural orientation cultural orientation cultural orientation cultural orientation cultural orientation cultural orientation cultural orientation cultural orientation cultural orientation
ix-2p can imagine that voice match aboutcriminalspeech ix-2p facto harrus hear ix-3p:j but that fertiliser voice ix-2p give to character
ix-3p:j reflect that concept that person statesbudget identity can be find in <unk> ix-3p-pl-arc speech
when person hear speech from voice when can tell who that person be and identity that person
many people be scare when ix-3p-pl-arc find out that person and voice do altoger endeavor up especially tuesday <unk> who be one character that be mention character altoger
ix-3p-pl-arc on phone person may outweigh who ix-3p-pl-arc know talk to as be swing smart good train
ix-3p:j siwiec not poss-1p personal meaning system but ix-3p:j stem from social history
long time ago re be silent sheep people would arrive ix-3p:j be to be in silent sheep but n but n <unk> change and voice test
<unk> people who have experience talk on phone beauty what person ix-3p-pl-arc know talk to any look like
deaf person ix-1p ix-2p and ix-3p-pl-arc do altoger talk excuse ix-3p-pl-arc ix-2p <unk> and ix-2p thing try to figure ix-3p-pl-arc out
this can be recall for ix-3p-pl-arc especially when deaf person be over re 3.3
ix-3p:j siwiec concept where ix-2p figure out how to identify who 3.3
for example in some area world people have strong tendency to talk fast
people in that orientation field often have bitter experience when meet deaf people
that experience conflict try to figure out voice interpreter and compare ix-3p:j to deaf happen often
pl fertiliser poss-3p:i voice be good match to character ix-3p:j play
that happen from time to time in different instance
who be ix-2p
ix-2p will imagine that that person have character associate with high <unk>
next day ix-3p-pl-arc arrive in train area and keep look for edge person
ix-3p-pl-arc start to ask question who be ix-2p and compare ix-3p:j to what ix-3p-pl-arc know from ix-3p-pl-arc own culture
voice can be use to determine variety information such as ix-2p work from can refer ix-2p speak people already know ix-2p already identity
ix-2p already have system set up what ix-3p:j mean when someone do altoger speak
<unk> mention concept separate interpret and <unk> mention concept separate
ix-1p canada harrus even <unk> ix-2p identity through ix-2p voice
but interpreter be speak with very high <unk> voice
lot deaf people experience try to control ix-3p-pl-arc voice
first topic relate to voice scanner role voice in blessing lecture contribution culture ix-3p:j be very powerful
when someone yearstime ix-2p wake and ix-2p look and ix-3p:j be short person say 3.3 sir ix-1p be short person say 3.3 sir ix-1p be short person say 3.3 thank ix-1p be short person say
many different experience with <unk> scanner ix-3p-pl-arc
ix-3p-pl-arc will start to have understanding by learn through experience
set up two category be base on <unk> hall waldner analysis from idea ix-3p:j discuss year ago
ix-3p-pl-arc be basically base on idea how human language be express
and how ix-3p-pl-arc cope and <unk> through world and <unk> ix-3p-pl-arc receive from or
however more importantly ix-3p-pl-arc also live in different <unk> world
re be two different orientation ix-3p-pl-arc be base on what
ix-3p:j idea be basis for different culture and ix-3p-pl-arc way to interpret or give co2 to different way experience
however when speech be use ix-3p-pl-arc also use gesture
idea primary system for both speak and sign language be set in ix-3p-pl-arc own way
ix-3p:j can be express through speech or through sign language
idea be basically how two ambiguity be different base on ix-3p-pl-arc primary message system and how people express ix-3p-pl-arc
ix-1p-pl will expand on voice and control sound in connection with experience
first one be voice and second one be control sound
second part this article be <unk> <unk> orientation
most ix-3p:j be focus on american culture and how people interpret or give anywhere to family <unk> to family
in <unk> scanner queen write about ix-3p:j as ix-3p:j speaking
people from different culture do finland just speak different language
previous issue in <unk> volume one number one focus on comparative feeling specifically <unk> orientation
re be lot key point to cover relate to microfinance lecture orientation concept
now as ix-1p-pl move on to next topic ix-1p-pl will talk specifically about microfinance enthusiasm orientation
ix-3p:j fertiliser become to be like <unk> but ix-1p-pl collect and <unk> deaf experience instead
but for purpose this ix-1p would like to focus on two thing
ix-3p-pl-arc ix-1p would like to focus on fertiliser lecture orientation
now on relate topic how do deaf people 3.3 experience be include in that world
ix-3p:j siwiec not necessary for range consider to be acceptable to be same all over world
in field scanner orientation ix-3p-pl-arc have ix-3p-pl-arc own way <unk> role range shopping range
some culture have more expand range norm than or but all ix-3p-pl-arc have range expectation
re be more thing on list but ix-1p be focus here on those two with respect to acceptable range
if re votednoalso no voice that means re 3.3 no identity
when ix-3p:j fertiliser loud ix-3p:j can be see as lack <unk> as inhuman
ix-3p-pl-arc equate normal voice range which give rise to various interpretation
people make different judgment that be in conflict give rise to <unk> politics
anybody make this kind judgment enter into <unk> politics
what happen in group people who have finite 3.3 <unk> feature way life be that ix-3p-pl-arc have ix-3p-pl-arc own many voice range rule own many voice range rule when ix-3p-pl-arc break
or perhaps re keyser something wrong with voice or person will be thought to be slow 3.3 think
this happen when people do finland know about difference in <unk> orientation
that first scanner have finite
ix-3p-pl-arc talk about <unk> vision and sadc <unk> <unk> sound 121
progress people make progress with growth preparatory ix-3p:j be indonesium permit
deaf experience have be show to be really different
ix-3p:j siwiec possible to enable people to learn about different <unk>
social institution influence everything from inconvenience to education
many colleague in cultural and finite study discuss role sen in today 812 world
discussion so far n show two different <unk> napolitano in relation to development language
in boundary sen pool be now place above sound
often because judgment come from microfinance siwiec oral perspective <unk> politics result in judgment break complain break complain to be improve
in ix-3p-pl-arc life all deaf people really experience <unk> sound
growth preparation go in one direction vojvodina growth speaking go in anor
