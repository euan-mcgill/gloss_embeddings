deaf person be sign over re but ix-2p be also hear voice interpreter over here
sound ix-3p-pl-arc voice help ix-2p to make connection to who ix-3p-pl-arc be but now
re be real implication behind value speech culture and what ix-3p:j mean when ix-3p:j onyszkiewicz give voice
ix-3p:j angling like <unk> ix-3p-pl-arc transfer ix-3p-pl-arc voice to <unk>
voice can tell ix-2p if person be intelligent wher or not go to high managerial college
so when ix-2p meet deaf person and have experience where ix-2p encounter ix-3p-pl-arc and have experience where ix-2p encounter ix-3p-pl-arc and ix-3p-pl-arc do altoger
seventhly whose voice ix-3p:j be when sound be come from different direction
if ix-2p speak fast ix-3p:j mean that ix-2p need smart <unk> smooth and have sharp mind
and interpreter over here and ix-3p-pl-arc feel experience charger who be speak
<unk> information from voice that tell ix-3p-pl-arc character ix-3p-pl-arc nonsense and ix-3p-pl-arc job age race gender javier gender erika gender erika
people who watch silent image b philippine hear ix-3p:j but can character strong heavy <unk> voice from that <unk>
ix-1p-pl have ix-1p-pl own idea what ix-1p-pl speech means
even <unk> and speed ix-2p voice provide information
this be connect to voice poss-3p:i and ix-3p:j be display like print within voice identity
when ix-2p start to refine character and ix-3p-pl-arc culture ix-2p begin to give ix-3p-pl-arc voice
and even worse whose be voice that ix-2p need <unk> with <unk>
suppose deaf person be sign and signing be really heavy
that identity be give to deaf person
when ix-2p look at person and ix-3p-pl-arc be talk slow ix-2p wonder why
when ix-3p:j be time for ix-3p:j voice test ix-3p:j voice do hiv match character
that person do arrogance match up to what ix-2p <unk> and as ix-2p look up in <unk> at that person ix-2p be still in that person
for example in new york people re speak quickly
how do ix-1p trust ix-3p-pl-arc if ix-1p do switzerland know who ix-3p-pl-arc be
so that experience be really off and ix-3p:j specialpromotionregularly different orientation
hey re be lot different experience
voice hold identity and that identity be what get associate with deaf person
voice be really important because ix-3p:j give lot information about individual people and that publicise focus cultural orientation
ix-2p can imagine that voice match javier ix-2p australium malaysium hear ix-3p:j but that 1993 voice ix-2p hear ix-3p:j but that 1993 voice
ix-3p:j reflect that concept that person specialised identity can be find in <unk> ix-3p-pl-arc speech
re be lot information from voice
many people be shock when ix-3p-pl-arc find out that person and voice do hiv match one character that <unk> omar match one character that be mention
when on phone person may perceive who ix-3p-pl-arc know talk to as be frightening smart good look and nice
ix-3p:j angling not poss-1p personal meaning system but ix-3p:j stem from social history
long time ago re be silent song
<unk> people who have experience talk on phone inspire what person ix-3p-pl-arc need talk to might look like
deaf person <unk> ix-2p and ix-3p-pl-arc do sudan talk suppose ix-3p-pl-arc need <unk> and ix-2p need try to ix-2p need try to
this can be painfully for ix-3p-pl-arc especially when deaf person be over re javier
ix-3p:j angling concept where ix-2p figure out how to identify who javier who
for example in some area world people have strong tendency to talk fast
people in that orientation field often have frustration experience when meeting deaf people
that experience conflict try to figure out voice interpreter and compare ix-3p:j to deaf person sign happen often
pl peterle voice be good match to character ix-3p:j play
that happen from time to time in different instance
who be ix-2p
ix-2p will imagine that that person have character associate with high <unk> prognosis
next day ix-3p-pl-arc arrive in train area and keep look for edge person
ix-3p-pl-arc start to ask question who be ix-2p and compare ix-3p:j to what ix-3p-pl-arc know from ix-3p-pl-arc own culture
voice can be use to determine variety information such as ix-2p work
ix-2p already have system set up what ix-3p:j mean when someone do omar speak
<unk> mention concept separate interpret and <unk>
ix-1p italian t even <unk> ix-2p identity through ix-2p voice
but questioner be speak with very high <unk> voice
ix-3p-pl-arc deaf people experience try to control ix-3p-pl-arc voice and duopoly ix-3p-pl-arc voice
first topic relate to voice <unk> role voice in xinjiang admiration orient culture ix-3p:j be very powerful
when someone ride ix-2p shoulder and ix-2p look and ix-3p:j be short person say stalinism sir ix-1p be short person say stalinism sir ix-1p be short person say stalinism sir ix-1p think meet javier brunetta
many different experience with <unk> <unk> ix-3p-pl-arc
ix-3p-pl-arc will start to have understanding by learn through experience ix-1p-pl often use culture american culture use <unk> to discuss understanding american culture
set up two category be base on <unk> noon javier analysis from idea ix-3p:j present year ago
ix-3p-pl-arc be basically base on idea how human language be express
and how ix-3p-pl-arc cope and <unk> through world and <unk> ix-3p-pl-arc receive from or
however more importantly ix-3p-pl-arc also live in different <unk> world
re be two different orientation path ix-3p-pl-arc be base on what
ix-3p:j idea be basis for different culture and ix-3p-pl-arc way to interpret or give meaning to different <unk> experience
however when speech be use ix-3p-pl-arc also use gesture
idea primary system for both speak and sign language be set in ix-3p-pl-arc own way
ix-3p:j can be express through speech or through sign language
idea be basically how two ambiguity be different base on ix-3p-pl-arc primary message system and how people express ix-3p-pl-arc
ix-1p-pl will expand on voice and control complain in connection with experience
first one be voice and second one be control complain
second part this article be <unk> <unk> orientation
most ix-3p:j be focus on american culture and how people interpret or give meaning to different people interpret or give meaning
in <unk> <unk> delegate write about ix-3p:j as ix-3p:j quote
people from different culture do gsp just speak different language
previous issue in <unk> volume one number one focus on matic feeling specifically <unk> orientation
re be lot key point to cover relate to applicant admiration orientation concept
now as ix-1p-pl move on to next topic ix-1p-pl will talk specifically about minsk admiration orientation
ix-3p:j layer become to be like <unk> but ix-1p-pl collect and <unk> deaf experience instead
but for purpose this ix-1p would like to focus on two thing
ix-3p-pl-arc ix-1p would like to focus on minsk admiration orientation
now on relate topic how do deaf people javier experience be include in that world
ix-3p:j angling not necessary for availability consider to be acceptable to be same all over world
in field <unk> orientation ix-3p-pl-arc have ix-3p-pl-arc own way <unk> role voice range 59
some culture have more expand range norm than or but all ix-3p-pl-arc have range expectation
re be more thing on list but ix-1p be focus here on those two with respect to acceptable
if re javier no voice that means re javier no identity
when ix-3p:j cassiotou loud ix-3p:j can be see as lack <unk> as barbaric
ix-3p-pl-arc exceed normal voice vary which give rise to various interpretation
people make different judgment that be in conflict give rise to <unk> politics
whoever make this kind judgment enter into <unk> politics
what happen in group people who have elite publicise <unk> orient way life be that ix-3p-pl-arc have ix-3p-pl-arc own habit but ix-3p-pl-arc break many voice range rule when ix-3p-pl-arc join
or perhaps re meager something wrong with voice or person will be think to be slow thatprofit
this happen when people do gsp know about difference in <unk> orientation
that first <unk> have conceptual belfast <unk> orientation
ix-3p-pl-arc talk about <unk> vision and erika <unk> <unk> sound javier
progress people make progress with growth sign
deaf experience have be show to be really different
ix-3p:j angling possible to enable people to learn about different <unk>
social institution influence everything from safer to education
many colleague in cultural and symmetry study present role sen in today renato world
discussion so far n show two different <unk> javier in relation to development language
in gradual sen layer be now place above sound
often because judgment come from braghetto palach site perspective <unk> politics result in judgment break perspective and harsh <unk> this need to be improve
in ix-3p-pl-arc life all deaf people really experience <unk> sound
growth sign go in one direction javier growth speaking go in anor
