loud person be sign over re but ix-2p be also hearing voice distress over here
sound ix-3p-pl-arc voice help ix-2p to make connection to who ix-3p-pl-arc be but now
re be real implication behind value speech culture and what ix-3p:j mean when ix-3p:j elbow give voice
ix-3p:j bissau like <unk> when transfer ix-3p-pl-arc voice to <unk>
voice can tell ix-2p if person be intelligent wher or not ix-3p-pl-arc go to college and wher or not or college and wher and wher or not or college
so when ix-2p meet deaf person and have experience where ix-2p lambsdorff ix-3p-pl-arc and figure ix-3p-pl-arc barcelona young ix-2p try cinema to figure ix-3p-pl-arc
claudio whose voice ix-3p:j be when sound be come from different direction
if ix-2p speak fast ix-3p:j mean that ix-2p need smart <unk> smooth and have sharp mind
and epp over here and ix-3p-pl-arc feel experience device who be speak
ix-2p information from voice that tell ix-3p-pl-arc sen ix-3p-pl-arc proposition orientation quantity age race gender sexual orientation
people who watch silent film holder t hear ix-3p:j but can imagine strong heavy <unk> poss-3p:i voice from that <unk>
ix-1p-pl have ix-1p-pl own idea what ix-1p-pl speech mean
even <unk> and speed ix-2p voice provide information
this be connect to voice poss-3p:i and ix-3p:j be display like print within voice identity
when ix-2p start to compete character and ix-3p-pl-arc culture ix-2p begin to give ix-3p-pl-arc voice
and even worse whose be voice that ix-2p need <unk> with <unk>
lastly deaf person be sign and sign be really heavy
that identity be give to deaf person
when ix-2p look at person and ix-3p-pl-arc be talk slow ix-2p wonder why
when ix-3p:j be time for ix-3p:j voice test ix-3p:j voice do gsp match
that person do hezbollah match up to what ix-2p <unk> and as ix-2p look up in <unk>
for example in new david people re speak quickly
how do ix-1p trust ix-3p-pl-arc if ix-1p do tamil know who ix-3p-pl-arc be
so that experience be really off and ix-3p:j apologise different orientation
envious re be lot different experience
voice hold identity and that identity be what get associate with deaf person
voice be really important because ix-3p:j give lot information about individual people and that severin focus cultural orientation
ix-2p can imagine that voice match aboutcriminalspeech ix-2p facto hezbollah hear ix-3p:j but that install voice ix-2p give to character
ix-3p:j common that concept that person baringdorf identity can be find in <unk> ix-3p-pl-arc speech
when person hear speech from voice ix-3p-pl-arc can tell who that person be and identity that person
many people be shock when ix-3p-pl-arc find out that person and voice do t match up character tamil <unk> who be one character that be mention
when on phone person may tolerate who ix-3p-pl-arc come talk person next day near land good step
ix-3p:j bissau not poss-1p personal meaning system but ix-3p:j stem from social history
long time ago re be silent tv
<unk> people who have experience talk on phone motivate what person ix-3p-pl-arc need talk to might look like
loud person <unk> ix-2p and ix-3p-pl-arc do whereas talk tolerate ix-3p-pl-arc develop <unk> and ix-2p need try to figure ix-3p-pl-arc try
this can be awkward for ix-3p-pl-arc especially when deaf person be over re
ix-3p:j bissau concept where ix-2p figure out how to identify who ciwin
for example in some area world people have strong tendency to talk fast
people in that orientation field often have faithful experience when meeting baby people
that experience conflict try to figure out voice phone and compare ix-3p:j to laugh person voice happen often
david pirker voice be good match to character ix-3p:j play
that happen from time to time in different instance
who be ix-2p
ix-2p will imagine that that person have character associate with high <unk> tone
next day ix-3p-pl-arc arrive in train area and keep look for edge person
ix-3p-pl-arc start to ask question who be ix-2p and compare ix-3p:j to what ix-3p-pl-arc know from ix-3p-pl-arc own culture
voice can be use to determine variety information such as ix-2p work ix-2p function ix-2p identity and can comment who ix-2p be base on ix-2p voice
ix-2p already have system set up what ix-3p:j mean when someone do whereas speak
<unk> mention concept separate validity and <unk>
ix-1p usa harrus even <unk> ix-2p identity through ix-2p voice
but tractor be speak with very high <unk> voice
lot deaf people experience try to control ix-3p-pl-arc voice and statesmanship ix-3p-pl-arc voice
first topic relate to voice <unk> role voice in bruge forceful orient culture ix-3p:j be very powerful
when someone switch ix-2p shoulder and ix-2p look and ix-3p:j be short person say <unk> laugh delor and ix-2p need distance because scan 59 and ix-2p learn older because 204a ciwin and ix-2p learn
many different experience with <unk> <unk> ix-3p-pl-arc
ix-3p-pl-arc will start to have understand by learn through experience understanding american culture through <unk> to discuss understanding american culture
set up two category be base on <unk> hall
ix-3p-pl-arc be basically base on idea how human language be express
and how ix-3p-pl-arc ease and <unk> through world and <unk> ix-3p-pl-arc receive from or
however more importantly ix-3p-pl-arc also live in different <unk> world
re be two different orientation path ix-3p-pl-arc be base on what
ix-3p:j idea be basis for different culture and ix-3p-pl-arc way to interpret or give meaning to different <unk> experience
however when speech be use ix-3p-pl-arc also use gesture
idea primary system for both speak and sign language be set in ix-3p-pl-arc own way
ix-3p:j can be express through speech or through sign language
idea be basically how two certainty be different base on ix-3p-pl-arc primary message system and how people express ix-3p-pl-arc
ix-1p-pl will expand on voice and control sound in connection with experience
first one be voice and second one be control sound
second part this article be <unk> <unk> orientation
most ix-3p:j be focus on american poss-3p:i culture and how people convey or give meaning to different <unk> to family
in <unk> <unk> hall write about ix-3p:j as ix-3p:j quote
people from different culture do barcelona just speak different language
previous issue in <unk> volume one number one review on standpoint feeling specifically <unk> orientation
re be lot key point to cover relate to organisational lecture orientation concept
now as ix-1p-pl move on to next topic ix-1p-pl will talk specifically about bruge sympatic orientation
nomination ix-1p-pl become to be like <unk> but ix-1p-pl collect and <unk> deaf experience instead
but for purpose this ix-1p would like to focus on two thing
ix-3p-pl-arc ix-1p would like to focus on patientsright lecture orientation
now on relate topic how do deaf people delor experience be include in that world
ix-3p:j bissau not necessary for availability consider to be acceptable to be same all over world
in field <unk> orientation ix-3p-pl-arc have ix-3p-pl-arc own way <unk> role voice range charger
some culture have more expand range norm than or but all ix-3p-pl-arc have range expectation
re be more thing on list but ix-1p be focus here on those two with respect to acceptable range
if re becsey no voice that mean re severin no identity
when ix-3p:j bissau loud ix-3p:j can be see as lack <unk> as barbaric
ix-3p-pl-arc exceed normal voice range which give rise to various interpretation
people make different judgment that be in conflict over rise to <unk> politics
whoever make this kind judgment enter into <unk> politics
what happen in group people who have finite 59 <unk> orient way range rule when ix-3p-pl-arc break many voice range rule when ix-3p-pl-arc break many voice range rule when ix-3p-pl-arc break many voice range
or perhaps re utilise something wrong with voice or person will be think to be slow 170 minded
this happen when people do barcelona know about difference in <unk> orientation
or first <unk> have conceptual 59 <unk> orientation
ix-3p-pl-arc talk about <unk> vision and bush <unk> <unk> sound severin
progress people make progress with growth sign
loud experience have be show to be really different
ix-3p:j bissau possible to enable people to learn about different <unk>
social institution influence everything from prescription to education thing in different way
many colleague in cultural and comfort study discuss role sen in today 59 world
discussion so far n show two different <unk> markov in relation to development language
in precept sen pool be now place above sound
often because judgment come from bruge wogau oral perspective <unk> politics result in judgment break sound and forceful <unk> this need to be improve
in ix-3p-pl-arc life all deaf people really experience <unk> sound
growth sign go in one direction
