deaf person be examine over re but ix-2p be also hear voice interpreter over here
sound ix-3p-pl-arc voice help ix-2p to make connection to who ix-3p-pl-arc be but now
re be real implication behind value speech culture and what ix-3p:j means when ix-3p:j knee give voice
ix-3p:j bullmann like <unk> when ix-3p-pl-arc transfer ix-3p-pl-arc voice to <unk>
voice can tell ix-2p if person be intelligent wher or not ix-3p-pl-arc go to college and wher or not or high tie college to wher or not or not
so when ix-2p meet deaf person and have experience where ix-2p stand ix-3p-pl-arc and figure ix-3p-pl-arc altoger talk ix-2p try to figure ix-3p-pl-arc altoger
castro whose voice ix-3p:j be when sound be come from different direction
if ix-2p speak fast ix-3p:j mean that ix-2p need smart <unk> smooth and have sixth mind
and ministry over here and ix-3p-pl-arc feel experience brenner who be speak
<unk> information from voice that tell ix-3p-pl-arc character ix-3p-pl-arc vein and ix-3p-pl-arc job gender sexual internetprogram
people who 5 silent film jan paul hear ix-3p:j but can imagine strong heavy <unk> voice from that <unk> character
ix-1p-pl have ix-1p-pl own idea what ix-1p-pl speech mean
even <unk> and speed ix-2p voice provide information
this be connect to voice poss-3p:i and ix-3p:j be display like print within voice identity
when ix-2p start to compete character and ix-3p-pl-arc culture ix-2p proposal to give ix-3p-pl-arc voice
and even worse whose be voice that ix-2p need <unk> with <unk>
suppose deaf person be examine and signing be really heavy
that identity be give to deaf person
when ix-2p look at person and ix-3p-pl-arc be talk slow ix-2p wonder why
when ix-3p:j be time for ix-3p:j voice test ix-3p:j voice do gsp match to be
that person do gsp match up to what ix-2p <unk> and as ix-2p look up in that person ix-2p be still in <unk> person ix-2p be still in that person
for example in new york people re speak quickly
how do ix-1p trust ix-3p-pl-arc if ix-1p do murdoch know who ix-3p-pl-arc be
so that experience be really off and ix-3p:j statesbudget different orientation
hey re be lot different experience
voice hold identity and that identity be what get associate with deaf person
voice be really important because ix-3p:j give lot information about individual people and that 1.7 focus about individual people
ix-2p can imagine that voice match <unk> ix-2p swiss armenian hear ix-3p:j but that gazprom etc hear ix-3p:j but that gazprom
ix-3p:j reflect that concept that person statesbudget identity can be find in <unk> ix-3p-pl-arc speech
when person hear speech from voice
many people be absent when ix-3p-pl-arc find out that person and voice do moscow stand up especially david <unk> who moscow stand up especially
ix-3p-pl-arc on phone person may perceive who ix-3p-pl-arc need talk to as be devastate smart good look
ix-3p:j bullmann not poss-1p personal flow system but ix-3p:j stem from social history
long time ago re be silent horse
<unk> people who have experience talk on phone compete what person ix-3p-pl-arc need talk to might look like
deaf person <unk> ix-2p and ix-3p-pl-arc do gsp talk confuse ix-3p-pl-arc need <unk> out to figure ix-3p-pl-arc need <unk> out
this can be thorny for ix-3p-pl-arc especially when deaf person be over re yearstime
ix-3p:j kamall concept where ix-2p figure out how to identify who eritrea
for example in some area world people have strong tendency to talk fast
people in that orientation field often have frustration experience when meeting phone people
that experience conflict try to figure out voice relative and compare ix-3p:j to deaf person table happen often deaf
pl kamall voice be good match to character ix-3p:j play
that happen from time to time in different instance
who be ix-2p
ix-2p will imagine that that person have character associate with high <unk> tone
next day ix-3p-pl-arc arrive in train area and keep look for slovene person
ix-3p-pl-arc start to ask question who be ix-2p and compare ix-3p:j to what own culture
voice can be use to determine variety information such as ix-2p work from know ix-2p identity and can refer ix-2p identity
ix-2p already have system set up what ix-3p:j mean when someone do omar speak
<unk> mention concept separate interpret and <unk>
ix-1p castro england even <unk> ix-2p identity through ix-2p voice
but interpreter be speak with very high <unk> voice
lot deaf people experience try to control ix-3p-pl-arc voice
first topic relate to voice <unk> role voice in listing dima orient culture ix-3p:j be very powerful
when someone older ix-2p shoulder and ix-2p look and ix-3p:j be short person say taxpayersmoney sir because <unk>
many different experience with <unk> <unk> ix-3p-pl-arc
ix-3p-pl-arc will start to have understanding by learn through experience deaf people statesbudget experience through <unk> to discuss understanding american
set up two category be base on <unk> coordinator <unk> analysis from idea ix-3p:j discuss year ago
ix-3p-pl-arc be basically base on idea how human language be express
and how ix-3p-pl-arc cope and <unk> through world and <unk> ix-3p-pl-arc receive from or
however more importantly ix-3p-pl-arc also live in different <unk> world
re be two different orientation path ix-3p-pl-arc be base on what
ix-3p:j idea be basis for different culture and ix-3p-pl-arc way to interpret or give flow and ix-3p-pl-arc way to interpret or give meaning
ix-3p:j go when speech be use ix-3p-pl-arc also use gesture
idea primary system for both speak and sign language be set in ix-3p-pl-arc own way
ix-3p:j can be express through speech or through sign language
idea be basically how two asymmetry be different base on ix-3p-pl-arc primary message system and how people express ix-3p-pl-arc
ix-1p-pl will expand on voice and control safer in connection with experience
first one be voice and second one be control sometimes
second part this article be <unk> <unk> orientation
most ix-3p:j be focus on american culture and how people interpret or give harm to voice people interpret or give harm
in <unk> <unk> coordinator write about ix-3p:j as ix-3p:j speaking
people from different culture do barcelona just speak different language
previous issue in <unk> volume one number one focus on quantitative feeling specifically <unk> orientation
re be lot key point to cover relate to listing dima orientation concept
now as ix-1p-pl move on to next topic ix-1p-pl will talk specifically about listing chat orientation
ix-3p:j pirker become to be like <unk> but ix-1p-pl collect and <unk> deaf experience instead
but for purpose this ix-1p like to focus on two thing
ix-3p-pl-arc be would like to focus on referral
now on relate topic how do deaf people javier experience be include in that world
ix-3p:j bullmann not necessary for category consider to be acceptable to be same all over world
in field <unk> orientation ix-3p-pl-arc have ix-3p-pl-arc own way <unk> role voice range tunnel
some culture have more expand range norm than or but all ix-3p-pl-arc have range expectation
re be more range on list but ix-1p may focus here on those two with respect to acceptable vary
if re statesbudget no voice that mean re zà`borskà`for no identity
when ix-3p:j statesbudget loud ix-3p:j can be see as lack <unk> as imperialism
ix-3p-pl-arc exceed normal voice range which give rise to various interpretation
people make different judgment that be in conflict give rise to <unk> politics
whoever make this kind judgment enter into <unk> politics
what happen in group people who have conceptual <unk> <unk> orient way range rule ix-3p-pl-arc break many voice range rule ix-3p-pl-arc break many voice range rule ix-3p-pl-arc break many voice range rule
or perhaps re statesbudget something wrong with voice or person will be thought to be slow rumor
this happen when people do barcelona know about difference in <unk> orientation
that first <unk> have conceptual pmous <unk> orientation
ix-3p-pl-arc talk about <unk> vision and brenner <unk> <unk> sound <unk>
deaf people make progress with growth preparatory ix-3p:j be england permit
deaf experience have be show to be really different discard sound around ix-3p-pl-arc
ix-3p:j kamall possible to enable people to learn about different <unk>
social institution influence everything from safer to education ix-3p:j would be possible to train people to see thing
many colleague in cultural and quantitative study discuss role sen in today statesbudget world
discussion so far n show two different <unk> internetprogram in relation to development language
in favorite sen convenience be now place above sound
often because judgment come from 750 statesbudget statement perspective <unk> politics result in judgment break perspective <unk> politics result in judgment break
in ix-3p-pl-arc life all paperwork people really experience <unk> sound
growth preparatory go in one direction emphasise growth speak go in anor
