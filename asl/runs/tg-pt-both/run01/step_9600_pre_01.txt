oh will give nursery to mor
deaf person be sign over re but ix-2p be also hear voice accomplice over here
sound ix-3p-pl-arc voice help ix-2p to make connection to who ix-3p-pl-arc be but now
re be real implication behind value speech culture and what ix-3p:j mean when ix-3p:j utilise give voice
ix-3p:j neighboursseemingly like <unk> ix-3p-pl-arc transfer ix-3p-pl-arc voice to <unk>
voice can tell ix-2p if person be intelligent wher or not ix-3p-pl-arc go to wher bureau or not ix-3p-pl-arc go to wher bureau college not go to wher bureau
so when ix-2p meet deaf person and have experience where ix-2p try to ix-3p-pl-arc do altoger talk ix-2p try to ix-3p-pl-arc do altoger talk ix-2p try out
spectre whose voice ix-3p:j be when sound be come from different direction
if ix-2p speak fast ix-3p:j mean that ix-2p ix-2p smart <unk> smooth and have sharp mind
and survivor over here and ix-3p-pl-arc feel experience scan who be speak
ix-2p information from voice that tell ix-3p-pl-arc character ix-3p-pl-arc triangle and ix-3p-pl-arc job age weight gender sexual traveller
people who watch silent film arabium arabium hear ix-3p:j but can imagine strong heavy <unk> voice from that <unk> character
ix-1p-pl have ix-1p-pl own idea what ix-1p-pl speech mean
even <unk> and speed ix-2p voice provide information
this be connect to voice poss-3p:i and ix-3p:j be display like print within voice identity
when ix-2p start to translate character and ix-3p-pl-arc culture ix-2p begin to give ix-3p-pl-arc voice
and even worse whose be voice that ix-2p ix-2p <unk> with <unk>
suppose deaf person be sign and signing be really heavy
that identity be give to deaf person
when ix-2p look at person and ix-3p-pl-arc be talk slow ix-2p wonder why and have triple mind
thing ix-3p:j be time for ix-3p:j voice test ix-3p:j voice do saudus match character
that person do saudus match up to what ix-2p <unk> and as ix-2p look up and down at that ix-2p look up and down at that ix-2p look up
for example in new tv people re speak quickly
how do ix-1p trust ix-3p-pl-arc if ix-1p do finland know who ix-3p-pl-arc be
so that experience be really off and ix-3p:j coreper different orientation
oh re be lot different experience
voice hold identity and that identity be what get associate with deaf person
voice be really important because ix-3p:j give lot information about individual people and that 110 focus cultural orientation
ix-2p can imagine that voice match holger ix-2p roosevelt arabium hear ix-3p:j but that 271 voice ix-2p give to character that 16.15 voice
ix-3p:j reflect that concept that person constituentsgrievance can be find in <unk> ix-3p-pl-arc speech
when person hear speech anor ix-3p-pl-arc can tell who that person be and identity that person
many people be shock when ix-3p-pl-arc find out that person and voice do generic be mention character that be mention character that be mention
ix-3p-pl-arc on phone person may perceive who ix-3p-pl-arc learn talk to nice
ix-3p:j neighboursseemingly not poss-1p personal co2 system but ix-3p:j plague from social history
people time ago re be silent image
<unk> people who have experience talk on phone inspire what person ix-3p-pl-arc need talk to might look like person talk
deaf person <unk> ix-2p and ix-3p-pl-arc do finland talk suppose ix-3p-pl-arc learn <unk> and ix-2p think try ix-3p-pl-arc learn <unk> and ix-2p think try
this can be awkward for ix-3p-pl-arc especially when deaf person be over re thierry
ix-3p:j enquiry concept where ix-2p figure out how to identify who 92 who
for example in some area world people have strong tendency to talk fast
people in that orientation field often have nervous experience when meeting deaf people
that experience conflict try to figure out voice epp and compare ix-3p:j to deaf person and compare ix-3p:j to deaf person sign
ix-3p:j martensreport voice be good match to character ix-3p:j play
that happen from time to time in different instance
who be ix-2p
ix-2p will imagine that that person have character associate with high <unk> tone
next day ix-3p-pl-arc arrive in train area and keep look for warmth person
ix-3p-pl-arc start to ask question who be ix-2p and compare ix-3p:j to what ix-3p-pl-arc know from ix-3p-pl-arc own culture
voice can be use to determine variety information such as ix-2p work know ix-2p identity and can judge who ix-2p be base on ix-2p be base
ix-2p already have system set up what ix-3p:j mean when someone do altoger speak
<unk> mention concept separate interpret and <unk>
ix-1p evan arabium even <unk> ix-2p identity through ix-2p voice
but son be speak with very high <unk> voice
lot deaf people experience try to control ix-3p-pl-arc voice
first topic relate to voice <unk> role voice in videoconferencing outgoing orient culture ix-3p:j be very powerful
when someone pour ix-2p shoulder and ix-2p look and ix-3p:j be short anoresult and ix-2p need surprise because what ix-2p see be different than what because ix-1p-pl ix-2p see be different than what because what ix-2p see be different than
many different experience with <unk> <unk> ix-3p-pl-arc
ix-3p-pl-arc will start to have understanding by learn through experience ix-1p-pl often use deaf people -rrb- experience
set up two category be base on <unk> archive wiurope analysis from idea ix-3p:j present year ago
ix-3p-pl-arc be basically base on idea how human language be express
and how ix-3p-pl-arc rebuild and <unk> through world and <unk> ix-3p-pl-arc receive from or
however more importantly ix-3p-pl-arc also live in different <unk> world
re be two different orientation path ix-3p-pl-arc be base on what
ix-3p:j idea be basis for different culture and ix-3p-pl-arc way to interpret or give american to different <unk> experience
ix-3p:j when speech be use ix-3p-pl-arc also use gesture
idea primary system for both speak and sign language be set in ix-3p-pl-arc own way
ix-3p:j can be express through speech or through sign language
idea be basically how two modality be different base on ix-3p-pl-arc primary message system and how people express ix-3p-pl-arc
ix-1p-pl will expand on voice and control sound in connection with experience
first one be voice and second one be control sound
second part this article be <unk> <unk> orientation
most ix-3p:j be focus on american culture and how people interpret or give co2 to different <unk> and voice
in <unk> <unk> hall write about ix-3p:j as ix-3p:j quote
people from different culture do saudus just speak different language
previous issue in <unk> volume one number one focus on nano feeling specifically <unk> poss-3p:i orientation
re be lot key point to cover relate to principal outgoing orientation concept
now as ix-1p-pl move on to next topic ix-1p-pl will talk specifically about coreper outgoing orientation
ix-3p:j enquiry become to be like <unk> but ix-1p-pl collect and <unk> deaf experience instead
but for purpose this ix-1p would like to focus on two thing
ix-3p-pl-arc ix-1p would like to focus on breast loyal orientation
now on relate topic how do deaf people criminalisation experience be include in that world
ix-3p:j neighboursseemingly not necessary for range consider to be acceptable to be same all over world
in field <unk> poss-3p:i orientation ix-3p-pl-arc have ix-3p-pl-arc own way <unk> role voice range zelaya
some culture have more expand range norm than or but all have range expectation
re be more thing on list but ix-1p be focus here on those two with respect to acceptable here
if re rationalise no voice that mean re andnoin no identity
when ix-3p:j sympathise loud ix-3p:j can be see as lack <unk> as barbaric
ix-3p-pl-arc exceed normal voice range which give rise to various interpretation
people make different judgment that be in conflict give rise to <unk> politics
whoever make this kind judgment enter into <unk> politics
what happen in group people who have segmentation 1944 <unk> orient way life be that ix-3p-pl-arc have ix-3p-pl-arc own habit but ix-3p-pl-arc break many own habit but ix-3p-pl-arc break many own habit but ix-3p-pl-arc break
or perhaps re ourvulnerability something wrong with voice or person will be think to be slow savior minded
this happen when people do saudus know about difference in <unk> orientation
or first <unk> have linear asweet <unk> orientation
ix-3p-pl-arc talk about <unk> vision and grey <unk> <unk> sound usefully
progress people make progress with growth signing
deaf experience have be show to be really different
ix-3p:j neighboursseemingly possible to enable people to learn about different <unk>
social institution influence everything from doctor to education
many colleague in cultural and nano study discuss role solidity in today 110 world
discussion so far n show two different <unk> <unk> in relation to development language
in assumption sen neighbourly be now place above sound
often because judgment come from athà?odule 1944 oral perspective <unk> politics result in harsh break sound and harsh <unk> this need to harsh <unk> this need
in ix-3p-pl-arc life all deaf people really experience <unk> sound
growth signing go in one direction 3.3 growth speak go in anor
