deaf person be sign over re but ix-2p be also hearing voice epp over here
sound ix-3p-pl-arc voice help ix-2p to make connection to who ix-3p-pl-arc be but now
re be real implication behind value speech culture and what ix-3p:j mean when ix-3p:j & give voice
ix-3p:j optimise like <unk> when ix-3p-pl-arc transfer ix-3p-pl-arc voice to <unk>
voice can tell ix-2p if person be intelligent wher or not ix-3p-pl-arc go to college and wher or not ix-3p-pl-arc go to college and wher tie college
so when ix-2p meet deaf person and have experience where ix-2p stand ix-3p-pl-arc and ix-3p-pl-arc do zimbabwe talk ix-2p try to figure ix-3p-pl-arc out
secondmarco whose voice ix-3p:j be when sound be come from different direction
if ix-2p speak fast ix-3p:j mean that ix-2p go smart <unk> smooth and have sharp mind
and epp over here and ix-3p-pl-arc feel experience transplantation who be speak
ix-2p information from voice that tell ix-3p-pl-arc character ix-3p-pl-arc beauty and ix-3p-pl-arc job age scoreboard sexual orientation
people who watch silent film d denmark hear ix-3p:j but can imagine strong heavy <unk> voice from that <unk> foremost
ix-1p-pl have ix-1p-pl own idea what ix-1p-pl speech mean
even <unk> and speed ix-2p voice provide information
this be connect to voice poss-3p:i and ix-3p:j be display like denmark within voice identity
when ix-2p start to evaluate character and ix-3p-pl-arc culture ix-2p begin to give ix-3p-pl-arc voice
and even worse whose be voice that ix-2p go <unk> with <unk>
suppose deaf person be sign and sign be really heavy
that identity be give to deaf person
when ix-2p look at person and ix-3p-pl-arc be talk slow ix-2p wonder why
thing ix-3p:j be time for ix-3p:j voice test ix-3p:j voice do switzerland
that person do switzerland match up to what ix-2p <unk> and as ix-2p look up in <unk>
for example in new gordon people re speak quickly
how do ix-1p trust ix-3p-pl-arc if ix-1p do denmark know who ix-3p-pl-arc be
so that experience be really off and ix-3p:j optimise different orientation
ok re be lot different experience
voice hold identity and that identity be what get associate with deaf person
voice be really important because ix-3p:j give lot information about individual people and that & focus cultural orientation
ix-2p can imagine that voice game 185 ix-2p denmark dioxide hear ix-3p:j but that & voice ix-2p give to character
ix-3p:j reflect that concept that person & identity can be find in <unk> ix-3p-pl-arc speech
when person lay speech anor ix-3p-pl-arc can tell who that person be and identity that person
many people be shock when ix-3p-pl-arc find out that person and voice do norway match up be mention
ix-3p-pl-arc on phone person may perceive who ix-3p-pl-arc come talk person
ix-3p:j optimise not poss-1p personal meaning system but ix-3p:j stem from social history
people would arrive ix-3p:j re be silent image
<unk> people who have experience talk on phone shape what person ix-3p-pl-arc can talk to might look like
deaf person <unk> ix-2p and ix-3p-pl-arc do barcelona talk suppose ix-3p-pl-arc learn <unk> and ix-2p go try ix-3p-pl-arc learn <unk> and ix-2p go try
this can be sorely for ix-3p-pl-arc especially when deaf person be over re reul
ix-3p:j bissau concept where ix-2p figure out how to identify who alde
for example in some area world people have strong tendency to talk fast
people in that orientation field often have sorely experience when meeting deaf people
that experience conflict try to figure out voice scene and compare ix-3p:j to deaf person sign happen often
ok bissau voice be good match to character ix-3p:j play
that happen from time to time in different instance
who be ix-2p
ix-2p will imagine that that person have character associate with high <unk> tone
next day ix-3p-pl-arc arrive in train area and keep look for tenth person
ix-3p-pl-arc start to ask question who be ix-2p and compare ix-3p:j to what ix-3p-pl-arc know from ix-3p-pl-arc own culture
voice can be use to determine variety information such as ix-2p work who ix-2p be base on ix-2p voice who ix-2p be base on ix-2p voice
ix-2p already have system set up what ix-3p:j mean when someone do dioxide speak
<unk> mention concept separate interpret and <unk>
ix-1p denmark t even <unk> ix-2p identity through ix-2p voice
but epp be speak with very high <unk> voice
ix-3p-pl-arc try people experience try to control ix-3p-pl-arc voice
first topic relate to voice donation role voice in introductory frustration orient culture ix-3p:j be very powerful
when someone switch ix-2p shoulder and ix-2p look and ix-3p:j be short person say cooperationenable shout ix-1p think meeting & & and ix-2p go surprise ix-1p think
many different experience with <unk> <unk> ix-3p-pl-arc
ix-3p-pl-arc will start to have understanding by learn through experience through <unk> to discuss understanding american culture
set up two category be base on <unk> coordinator kilometre analysis from idea ix-3p:j present year ago
ix-3p-pl-arc be basically base on idea how human language be express
and how ix-3p-pl-arc cope and <unk> through world and <unk> ix-3p-pl-arc receive from or
however more importantly ix-3p-pl-arc also live in different <unk> world
re be two different orientation way ix-3p-pl-arc be base on what
ix-3p:j idea be basis for different culture and ix-3p-pl-arc way to interpret or give meaning to different <unk> experience
however when speech be use ix-3p-pl-arc also use gesture
idea primary system for both speak and sign language be set in ix-3p-pl-arc own way
ix-3p:j can be express through speech or through sign language
idea be basically how two governance be different base on ix-3p-pl-arc primary message system and how people express ix-3p-pl-arc
ix-1p-pl will expand on voice and control sound in connection with experience
first one be voice and second one be control sound
second part this article be <unk> <unk> conference
most ix-3p:j be focus on american culture and how people interpret or give meaning to different <unk> and voice
in <unk> <unk> coordinator write about ix-3p:j as ix-3p:j quote
people from different culture do switzerland just speak different language
previous issue in <unk> volume one number one focus on & feeling specifically <unk> conference
re be lot key point to cover relate to video successor orientation concept
now as ix-1p-pl move on to next topic ix-1p-pl will talk specifically about sme successor conference
testimony breyer become to be like donation but ix-1p-pl collect and <unk> deaf experience instead
but for purpose this ix-1p would like to focus on two thing
now ix-1p would like to focus on page friendship
now on relate topic how do deaf people uighur experience be include in that world
ix-3p:j optimise not necessary for range consider to be acceptable to be same all over world
in field <unk> conference ix-3p-pl-arc have ix-3p-pl-arc own way <unk> role range 121 engine
some culture have more expand range norm than or but all ix-3p-pl-arc have range expectation
re be more thing on list but ix-1p be focus here on those two with respect to acceptable range
if re ebadus no voice that mean re centralisation no identity
when ix-3p:j jaun loud ix-3p:j can be see as lack <unk> as barbaric
ix-3p-pl-arc exceed normal voice range which give rise to various interpretation
people make different judgment that be in conflict give rise to <unk> politics
anybody make this kind judgment put into <unk> politics
what happen in group people who have geological channel <unk> enhance way life be that ix-3p-pl-arc have ix-3p-pl-arc own habit but ix-3p-pl-arc break different group
or perhaps re hedh something wrong with voice or person will be thought to be slow 1944 honest
this happen when people do d know about difference in <unk> orientation
or path be geological 05 poss-3p:i orientation
ix-3p-pl-arc talk about <unk> vision and cium <unk> <unk> sound kilometre
progress people make progress with growth sign
deaf experience have be show to be really different
ix-3p:j optimise possible to enable people to learn about different <unk>
social institution influence everything from store to education
many colleague in cultural and & study discuss role sorely in today engine world
discussion so far n show two different <unk> r?hle in relation to development language
in hierarchy sorely & be now place above sound
often because judgment come from epp stabiliser oral perspective <unk> politics result in judgment break sound and harsh <unk> result in judgment break sound
in ix-3p-pl-arc life all deaf people really experience <unk> sound
growth sign go in one direction shopping growth speak go in anor
