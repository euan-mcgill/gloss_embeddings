deaf person be sign over re but ix-2p be also hear voice officer over here
sound ix-3p-pl-arc voice help ix-2p to make connection to who ix-3p-pl-arc be but now
re be real implication behind value speech culture and what ix-3p:j mean when ix-3p:j founder give voice
ix-3p:j saidyesterday like <unk> when ix-3p-pl-arc transfer ix-3p-pl-arc voice to <unk>
voice can tell ix-2p if person be intelligent wher or not ix-3p-pl-arc go to college and wher rank college
so when ix-2p meet deaf person and have experience where ix-2p encounter ix-3p-pl-arc and to do ix-3p-pl-arc out ix-2p encounter ix-3p-pl-arc and figure ix-3p-pl-arc out
braghetto whose voice ix-3p:j be when sound be come from different direction
if ix-2p speak fast ix-3p:j mean that ix-2p learn smart <unk> smooth and have sharp mind
and son over here and ix-3p-pl-arc feel experience cc who be speak
<unk> information from voice that tell ix-3p-pl-arc character ix-3p-pl-arc perception and ix-3p-pl-arc job sexual orientation insulation weight age race gender sexual 58
people who watch silent film mp t hear ix-3p:j but can imagine strong heavy <unk> poss-3p:i voice from that <unk> ambassador
ix-1p-pl have ix-1p-pl own idea what ix-1p-pl speech mean
even <unk> and speed ix-2p voice provide information
this be connect to voice poss-3p:i and ix-3p:j be perform like print within family identity
when ix-2p start to motivate character and ix-3p-pl-arc culture ix-2p begin to give ix-3p-pl-arc voice
and even worse whose be voice that ix-2p learn <unk> with <unk>
suppose deaf person be sign and sign be really heavy
that identity be deaf to deaf person
when ix-2p look at person and ix-3p-pl-arc be talk slow ix-2p wonder why
when ix-3p:j be time for ix-3p:j voice test ix-3p:j voice do finland match character
that person do malaysium match up to what ix-2p <unk> and as ix-2p look up and down at that ix-2p look up and down at
for example in new york people re speak quickly
how do ix-1p trust ix-3p-pl-arc if ix-1p do finland know who ix-3p-pl-arc be
so that experience be really off and ix-3p:j constituentsgrievance different orientation
oh re be lot different experience
voice hold identity and that identity be what get associate with deaf person
voice be really important because ix-3p:j give lot information about individual people and that savior focus cultural orientation people
ix-2p can imagine that voice match ticket ix-2p austrian rc hear ix-3p:j but that founder voice ix-2p give to character
ix-3p:j reflect that concept that person 58 identity can be find in <unk> ix-3p-pl-arc speech
re be lot information from voice when person hear speech anor ix-3p-pl-arc can tell who that person be and identity that person
many people be shock when ix-3p-pl-arc find out that person and voice do switzerland match up character that be mention
when on phone person may possess who ix-3p-pl-arc learn talk to as be jam smart good look and tear up next day near train and tear person next day
ix-3p:j saidyesterday not poss-1p personal mean system but ix-3p:j stem from social history
long time ago re be silent band
<unk> people who have experience talk on phone motivate what like ix-3p-pl-arc learn talk to might look like
deaf person <unk> ix-2p and ix-3p-pl-arc do nazism talk suppose ix-3p-pl-arc learn <unk> and ix-2p learn suppose ix-3p-pl-arc learn <unk> and ix-2p learn try to figure ix-3p-pl-arc
this can be rocky for ix-3p-pl-arc especially when deaf person be over re
ix-3p:j saidyesterday concept where ix-2p figure out how to identify who legged
for example in some area world people have strong tendency to talk fast
people in that orientation field often have famous experience when meeting deaf people
that experience conflict try to figure out voice son and compare ix-3p:j to deaf person sign happen often
pl hamon voice be good match to character ix-3p:j play ix-3p:j
that happen from time to time in different instance
who be ix-2p
ix-2p will imagine that that person have character associate with high <unk> tone
next day ix-3p-pl-arc arrive in train area and keep look for wear person
ix-3p-pl-arc start to ask question who be ix-2p and compare ix-3p:j to what ix-3p-pl-arc know from ix-3p-pl-arc own culture
voice can be use to determine variety information such as ix-2p work
ix-2p already have system set up what ix-3p:j mean when someone do finland speak
<unk> mention concept separate code and <unk>
ix-1p evan richard even <unk> ix-2p identity through ix-2p voice
but son be speak with very high <unk> voice
lot deaf people experience try to control ix-3p-pl-arc voice and conception ix-3p-pl-arc voice to control ix-3p-pl-arc to conception ix-3p-pl-arc voice
first topic relate to voice <unk> role voice in braghetto wholehearted orient culture ix-3p:j be very powerful
when someone relax ix-2p shoulder and ix-2p look and ix-3p:j be short person say 58 sir that thing be short person say 58 sir that think be short person and ix-2p learn surprise person what
many different experience with <unk> <unk> ix-3p-pl-arc
ix-3p-pl-arc will start to have understand by learn through experience ix-1p-pl often policy to discuss understanding american culture ix-1p-pl often use deaf american culture
set up two category be base on <unk> delegate moura analysis from idea ix-3p:j present year ago
ix-3p-pl-arc be basically base on idea how human language be express
and how ix-3p-pl-arc cope and <unk> through world and <unk> ix-3p-pl-arc receive from or
however more importantly ix-3p-pl-arc also live in different <unk> world
re be two different orientation path ix-3p-pl-arc be base on what
ix-3p:j idea be basis for different culture and ix-3p-pl-arc way to interpret or give acceptable to different <unk> experience
however when speech be use ix-3p-pl-arc also use gesture
idea primary system for both speak and sign language be set in ix-3p-pl-arc own way
ix-3p:j can be express through speech or through sign language
idea be basically how two modality be different base on ix-3p-pl-arc primary message system and how people express ix-3p-pl-arc
ix-1p-pl will expand on voice and control sound in connection with experience
first one be voice and second one be control sound
second part this article be <unk> <unk> orientation
most ix-3p:j be focus on american culture and how people interpret or and family mean to different <unk> and family
in <unk> <unk> director write about ix-3p:j as ix-3p:j quote
people from different culture do arab just speak different language
previous issue in <unk> volume one number one focus on neighbourly pretty specifically <unk> orientation
re be lot key point to cover relate to braghetto wholehearted orientation concept
now as ix-1p-pl move on to next topic ix-1p-pl will talk specifically about braghetto gratitude orientation
ix-3p:j saidyesterday become to be like <unk> but ix-1p-pl collect and <unk> deaf experience instead
but for purpose this ix-1p would like to focus on two thing
now ix-1p would like to focus on braghetto wholehearted orientation
now on relate topic how do deaf people earnestly experience be include in that world
ix-3p:j saidyesterday not necessary for designation consider to be acceptable to be same all over world
in field <unk> orientation ix-3p-pl-arc have ix-3p-pl-arc own way <unk> role voice range
some culture have more expand range threshold than or but all ix-3p-pl-arc have range expectation
re be more thing on list but ix-1p be focus here on those two with respect to acceptable range
if re 860 no voice that mean re eurocorp no identity
when ix-3p:j readsreduce loud ix-3p:j can be see as lack <unk> as barbaric
ix-3p-pl-arc exceed normal voice range which give rise to various interpretation
people make different judgment that be in conflict give rise to <unk> politics
whoever make this kind judgment during into <unk> politics
what happen in group people who have neighbourly constituentsgrievance <unk> orient way life be that ix-3p-pl-arc have ix-3p-pl-arc own habit rule when ix-3p-pl-arc join different group range rule when break many voice
or perhaps re erdf something wrong with voice or person will be think to be slow inuit minded
this happen when people do cod some about difference in <unk> orientation
that first <unk> have linear redd scanner orientation or path
ix-3p-pl-arc talk about <unk> vision and mast <unk> <unk> sound eurocontrol
deaf people make progress with growth sign progress could have be greater but ix-3p:j be switzerland permit
deaf experience have be show to be really different
ix-3p:j saidyesterday possible to enable people to learn about different <unk>
social institution influence everything from medicine to education ix-3p:j would be possible to train people to learn to see thing in different way
many colleague in cultural and nano study discuss role sen in today ferrero world
discussion so far n show two different <unk> moura in relation to development language
in conformity sen inner be now place above sound
often because judgment come from minsk thatmust oral perspective sound and harsh <unk> this need to be improve
in ix-3p-pl-arc life all deaf people really experience <unk> sound
growth sign go in one direction javier growth speaking go in anor
