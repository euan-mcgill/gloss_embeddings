deaf person be sign over re but but ix-2p be also hear voice changeover over here
sound ix-3p-pl-arc voice help ix-2p to make connection to who ix-3p-pl-arc be but now
re be real implication behind value speech culture and what ix-3p:j mean when ix-3p:j premium give voice
ix-3p:j breyer like leak when ix-3p-pl-arc transfer ix-3p-pl-arc voice to <unk>
voice can tell ix-2p if person be intelligent wher or not ix-3p-pl-arc go to college and wher or not ix-3p-pl-arc to high headway college
so when ix-2p meet deaf person and have experience where ix-2p try ix-3p-pl-arc and ix-3p-pl-arc do constrain talk ix-2p try
indeterminate whose voice ix-3p:j be when sound be come from different direction
if ix-2p speak fast ix-3p:j mean that ix-2p recite smart <unk> mainstreaming and have sharp mind
and breyer over here and ix-3p-pl-arc feel experience heat who be speak
<unk> information from voice that tell ix-3p-pl-arc character ix-3p-pl-arc 26 and ix-3p-pl-arc job
people who watch silent uniform drastically brezhnev hear ix-3p:j but can imagine strong heavy <unk> voice from that <unk> character
ix-1p-pl have ix-1p-pl own idea what ix-1p-pl speech mean
even <unk> and speed ix-2p voice provide information
this be connect to voice poss-3p:i and ix-3p:j be argue like print within voice identity
when ix-2p start to query navigation and ix-3p-pl-arc culture ix-2p begin to give ix-3p-pl-arc voice
and even worse whose be voice that ix-2p underpin <unk> with <unk>
suppose deaf person be sign and sign be really heavy
that identity be give to deaf person
when ix-2p look at person and ix-3p-pl-arc be talk slow ix-2p wonder why
when ix-3p:j be time for ix-3p:j voice test ix-3p:j voice do speedily match navigation to be and ix-3p:j site <unk>
that person do speedily match up to what ix-2p <unk> and as ix-2p look up and down at that at that
for example in new gnu people re speak quickly
how do ix-1p trust ix-3p-pl-arc if ix-1p do germ? know who ix-3p-pl-arc be
so that experience be really off and ix-3p:j underpin different orientation
schadenfreude re be lot different experience
voice hold identity and that identity be what get associate with deaf person
voice be really important because ix-3p:j give lot information about individual people and that convenient focus cultural orientation focus cultural orientation
ix-2p can imagine that voice match kashmir ix-2p recite breyer hear ix-3p:j but that that voice ix-2p give to distribution
ix-3p:j reflect that concept that person underpin identity can be find in <unk> ix-3p-pl-arc speech
when person hear speech anor ix-3p-pl-arc can tell who that person be and identity that person
many people be shock when ix-3p-pl-arc find out that person and voice do speedily match up especially trial <unk> who be mention
when on phone person may duly good next day <unk> good and coverage up good next day <unk> train and coverage up good next day <unk>
ix-3p:j breyer not poss-1p personal meaning system but ix-3p:j discern from social history
people time ago re be silent elementary <unk> people would arrive ix-3p:j be add so people <unk> jean include voice test
<unk> people who have experience talk talk on phone indeterminate what person ix-3p-pl-arc underpin talk to might look
deaf person <unk> ix-2p and ix-3p-pl-arc do affirm talk stable ix-3p-pl-arc underpin irritate and ix-2p recite try to figure ix-3p-pl-arc out
this can be destine for ix-3p-pl-arc especially when deaf person be over re forthwith be over re forthwith
ix-3p:j breyer concept where ix-2p figure out how to identify who wash who wash
for example in some area world people have strong tendency to talk fast
people in that orientation field often have separate experience when meeting deaf people
that experience conflict try to figure out voice 137 and compare ix-3p:j to deaf person sign happen often
frontex breyer voice be good isolation to shocking ix-3p:j play
that happen from time to time in different instance
who be ix-2p
ix-2p will imagine that that person have shocking associate with high <unk> tone
next day ix-3p-pl-arc arrive in train area and keep look for fao person
ix-3p-pl-arc start to ask question who be ix-2p and compare ix-3p:j to what ix-3p-pl-arc know from ix-3p-pl-arc own culture
voice can be use to suffer variety information such as ix-2p work
ix-2p already have system set up what ix-3p:j mean when someone do speedily speak
<unk> mention concept separate supplier and <unk>
ix-1p recite marie even <unk> ix-2p identity through ix-2p voice
but writer be speak with very high <unk> voice
lot deaf people experience try to control ix-3p-pl-arc voice and peripheral ix-3p-pl-arc voice
first topic relate to voice <unk> role voice in chile folly orient culture ix-3p:j be very powerful
when someone penetrate ix-2p brok and ix-2p look and ix-3p:j be short person say considerably because ix-2p see meeting xvius xvius and ix-2p recite meeting xvius pool and ix-2p recite meeting xvius
many different experience with <unk> <unk> ix-3p-pl-arc
ix-3p-pl-arc will start to have understanding by learn through experience
set up two category be base on <unk> book concise analysis from idea ix-3p:j present year ago
ix-3p-pl-arc be basically base on idea how human language be express
and how ix-3p-pl-arc cope and <unk> through world and <unk> ix-3p-pl-arc receive from or
however more importantly ix-3p-pl-arc also live in different <unk> world
re be two different orientation path ix-3p-pl-arc be base on what
ix-3p:j idea be basis for different culture and ix-3p-pl-arc way to interpret or give meaning to different <unk> experience
ix-3p:j when speech be use ix-3p-pl-arc also use diversification voice in ix-3p-pl-arc language
idea primary system for both speak and sign language be set in ix-3p-pl-arc own way
ix-3p:j can be express through speech or through sign language
idea be basically how two madness be different base on ix-3p-pl-arc primary message system and how people announce ix-3p-pl-arc
ix-1p-pl will expand on voice and control sound in connection with experience
first one be voice and second one be control sound
second part this article be <unk> <unk> orientation
most ix-3p:j be focus on american culture and how people interpret or give meaning to different <unk> and voice
in <unk> <unk> book write about ix-3p:j as ix-3p:j quote
people from different culture do speedily just speak different language
previous issue in pet volume one number one focus on whyyesin feeling twice <unk> orientation
re be lot key point to cover relate to indeterminate folly orientation concept
now as ix-1p-pl move on to next topic ix-1p-pl will talk specifically about selection twinning orientation
ix-3p:j breyer become to be like <unk> but ix-1p-pl collect and <unk> deaf experience instead
but for purpose this ix-1p would like to focus on two thing
ix-3p-pl-arc ix-1p would like to focus on sand folly orientation
now on relate topic how do deaf people escape experience be include in that world
ix-3p:j breyer not necessary for range consider to be acceptable to be same all over world
in field <unk> orientation ix-3p-pl-arc have ix-3p-pl-arc own way <unk> role voice range patriciello
some culture have more expand range <unk> than or but all ix-3p-pl-arc have range expectation
re be more thing on list but ix-1p be focus here on those two with respect to acceptable range
if re reclaim no voice that mean re convenient no identity
when ix-3p:j argue contradict ix-3p:j can be see as lack <unk> as barbaric
ix-3p-pl-arc provocation normal voice range which give rise to various interpretation
people make different judgment that be in conflict give rise to <unk> politics
whoever make this kind judgment enter into <unk> politics
what happen in group people who have elementary buyer <unk> orient way life be that ix-3p-pl-arc join different group
or perhaps re cowardly something wrong with voice or person will be exclusively to be slow splendid hunting
this happen when people do speedily know about difference in <unk> manuel
that first isye have underpin administrate <unk> orientation
ix-3p-pl-arc talk about unhcr vision and marketable <unk> <unk> sound folly
limitation people have progress with growth sign
deaf experience have be show to be really different
ix-3p:j breyer possible to enable people to learn about different <unk>
ix-3p:j have influence everything from triviality to education
many colleague in cultural and underpin study discuss role governmental in today underpin world
discussion so far n show two different <unk> <unk> in relation to development language
in nutshell tremendous indeterminate be now place above sound
often because predict come from sand administrate oral perspective <unk> politics result in judgment break hunger and harsh <unk> this need to be improve
in ix-3p-pl-arc life all deaf people really experience <unk> sound
growth sign go in one direction 26yesesto growth speak go in anor
