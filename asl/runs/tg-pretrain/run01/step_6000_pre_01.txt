deaf person be sign over re but ix-2p be also hear voice ecj over here
sound ix-3p-pl-arc voice help ix-2p to make connection to who ix-3p-pl-arc be but now be but now be but now be but now be but now
re be real implication behind value speech culture and what ix-3p:j means when ix-3p:j manifesto give voice
ix-3p:j 832 like <unk> when ix-3p-pl-arc transfer ix-3p-pl-arc voice to <unk>
voice can tell ix-2p if person be intelligent wher or not ix-3p-pl-arc go to civil and wher or not ix-3p-pl-arc go to civil and wher or not ix-3p-pl-arc go to civil and wher or not ix-3p-pl-arc go to civil and wher or not ix-3p-pl-arc go to civil and wher or not ix-3p-pl-arc go to civil and wher or not ix-3p-pl-arc go to civil and wher or not ix-3p-pl-arc go to civil and wher or not ix-3p-pl-arc go to civil and wher or not ix-3p-pl-arc go to civil and wher or not ix-3p-pl-arc go to civil and wher or not ix-3p-pl-arc go to civil and wher or not ix-3p-pl-arc go to civil and wher or not ix-3p-pl-arc go to civil and wher or not ix-3p-pl-arc go to civil and wher or not ix-3p-pl-arc go to civil and wher or not ix-3p-pl-arc go to civil and wher or not ix-3p-pl-arc go to civil and wher or not ix-3p-pl-arc go to civil and wher or not ix-3p-pl-arc go to civil and wher or not ix-3p-pl-arc go to civil and wher or not ix-3p-pl-arc go to civil and wher or not ix-3p-pl-arc go to civil and wher or not ix-3p-pl-arc go to civil and wher or not ix-3p-pl-arc go to civil and wher or not ix-3p-pl-arc go to civil and wher or not ix-3p-pl-arc go to civil and wher or not ix-3p-pl-arc go to civil and wher or not ix-3p-pl-arc go to civil and wher or not ix-3p-pl-arc go to civil and wher or
so when ix-2p ensure deaf person and have experience where ix-2p encounter ix-3p-pl-arc and ix-3p-pl-arc do nonsensical talk ix-2p try to figure ix-3p-pl-arc out
gordon whose voice ix-3p:j be when sound be come from different direction voice
if ix-2p speak fast ix-3p:j means that ix-2p champion smart <unk> smooth and have beat mind
and fiasco over here and ix-3p-pl-arc feel experience package who be speak
<unk> information from voice that tell ix-3p-pl-arc character ix-3p-pl-arc harrus and ix-3p-pl-arc job
people who watch silent violate literacy là?vai hear ix-3p:j but character
ix-1p-pl have ix-1p-pl own idea what ix-1p-pl speech means
even <unk> and speed ix-2p voice provide information
this be connect to voice poss-3p:i and ix-3p:j be display like print within voice identity
when ix-2p start to smile character and ix-3p-pl-arc culture ix-2p begin to give ix-3p-pl-arc voice
and even worse whose be voice that ix-2p champion <unk> with <unk>
composition deaf person be sign and really be really heavy
that identity be give to deaf person
when ix-2p look at person and ix-3p-pl-arc be talk slow ix-2p hope why
when ix-3p:j be time for ix-3p:j voice test ix-3p:j voice do like ix-3p-pl-arc use to be and ix-3p:j career
that person do shy match up to what ix-2p <unk> and as ix-2p look up and down at that person ix-2p be still in <unk>
for example in new ilo people re speak quickly
how do ix-1p trust ix-3p-pl-arc if ix-1p do shy know who ix-3p-pl-arc be
so that experience be really off and ix-3p:j critically different orientation
ideally re be lot different experience
voice hold identity and that identity be what get associate with box person
voice be really important because ix-3p:j give lot information orientation
ix-2p can imagine that voice match carrier ix-2p bolster cornillet hear ix-3p:j but that circumvent voice ix-2p give to air
ix-3p:j reflect that concept that person motorway identity can be find in <unk> ix-3p-pl-arc speech
re be lot information from voice can tell who that person be and identity that person
many people be shock when ix-3p-pl-arc find out that person <unk> who be one ix-3p-pl-arc that be mention
when on phone person may champion who ix-3p-pl-arc champion talk to as person next day near train and wear up next day near train and wear up next day near train and wear up next day near train and wear up next day near train and wear up next day near train and wear up next day near train and wear up next day near train and wear up next day near train and wear up next day near train and wear up next day near train and wear up next day near train and wear up next day near train and wear up next day near train and wear up next day near train and wear up next day near train and wear up next day near train and wear up next day near train and wear up next day near train and wear up next day near train and wear up next day near train and wear up next day near train and wear up next day near train and wear up next day near train and wear up next day near train and wear up next day near train and wear up next day near train and wear up next day near train and wear up next day near train and wear up next day near train and wear up next day near train and wear up next day near train and wear up next day near train and wear up next day near train and wear
ix-3p:j 832 not poss-1p personal applaud system but ix-3p:j stem from social history
people time ago re be silent starter
<unk> people who have experience talk on phone infancy what person ix-3p-pl-arc consumersinterest talk to might look like
deaf person <unk> ix-2p and ix-3p-pl-arc do shy talk composition ix-3p-pl-arc footprint <unk> and ix-2p schmidt try to figure ix-3p-pl-arc out
this can be almost for ix-3p-pl-arc especially when fly person be over re sharply when deaf person be over re sharply
ix-3p:j 832 concept where ix-2p figure out how to identify who omit
for example in some area world people have strong tendency to talk fast
people in that orientation field often have almost experience when meeting deaf people
that experience conflict try to figure out voice fiasco and compare ix-3p:j to deaf person sign happen often
circumvent ruijten voice be good match to air ix-3p:j character
that happen from time to time in different instance
who be ix-2p
ix-2p will imagine that that person have character associate with high <unk> tone
next day ix-3p-pl-arc arrive in train area and keep look for cure person
ix-3p-pl-arc start to ask question who be ix-2p and compare ix-3p:j to what ix-3p-pl-arc know from ix-3p-pl-arc own culture
voice can be use to torture subsidy information such as ix-2p ix-2p be base on ix-2p voice
ix-2p already have system set up what ix-3p:j means when someone do hesitant speak
<unk> mention concept separate troops and <unk>
ix-1p 832 elle even <unk> ix-2p identity through ix-2p voice
but fiasco be speak with very high <unk> voice
lot deaf people experience try to control ix-3p-pl-arc voice and cruel ix-3p-pl-arc voice to make voice
first topic relate to voice <unk> role voice in ilo jam orient culture ix-3p:j be very powerful
when someone sakalum ix-2p shoulder and ix-2p look and ix-3p:j be short person say neoliberalism because what ix-2p see be different than what ix-2p <unk> meeting
many different experience with <unk> <unk> ix-3p-pl-arc
ix-3p-pl-arc will start to have understanding by learn through experience to discuss understanding american culture experience through <unk> to discuss understanding american culture experience through <unk> to discuss understanding american culture experience through <unk> to discuss understanding american culture experience through <unk> to discuss understanding american culture experience through <unk> to discuss understanding american culture experience through <unk> to discuss understanding american culture experience through <unk> to discuss understanding american culture experience through <unk> to discuss understanding american culture experience through <unk> to discuss understanding american culture experience through <unk> to discuss understanding american culture experience through <unk> to discuss understanding american culture experience through <unk> to discuss understanding american culture experience through <unk> to discuss understanding american culture experience through <unk> to discuss understanding american culture experience through <unk> to discuss understanding american culture experience through <unk> to discuss understanding american culture experience through <unk> to discuss understanding american culture experience through <unk> to discuss understanding american culture experience through <unk> to discuss understanding american culture experience through <unk> to discuss understanding american culture experience through <unk> to discuss understanding american culture experience through <unk> to discuss understanding american culture experience through <unk> to discuss understanding american culture experience through <unk> to discuss understanding american culture experience through <unk> to discuss understanding american culture experience through <unk> to discuss understanding american culture experience through <unk> to discuss understanding american culture experience through <unk> to discuss understanding american culture experience through <unk> to discuss understanding american culture experience through <unk>
set up two category be base on <unk> literacy motorway analysis from idea ix-3p:j present year ago
ix-3p-pl-arc be basically base on idea how human language be express
and how ix-3p-pl-arc cope and <unk> through world and <unk> ix-3p-pl-arc receive from or
however more importantly ix-3p-pl-arc also live in different <unk> world
re be two different orientation path ix-3p-pl-arc be base on what
ix-3p:j idea be basis for different culture and ix-3p-pl-arc way to violence or give meaning to different <unk> experience
however when speech be use ix-3p-pl-arc also use embargo
idea primary system for both speak and sign language be set in ix-3p-pl-arc own way
ix-3p:j can be express through speech or through sign language
idea be basically how two fundamentalist be different base on ix-3p-pl-arc primary message system and how people express ix-3p-pl-arc
ix-1p-pl will expand on voice and control sound in connection with experience
first one be voice and second one be control sound
second part this article be <unk> <unk> orientation
most ix-3p:j be focus on american culture and how people interpret or give meaning to different <unk> and voice
in <unk> <unk> literacy write about ix-3p:j as ix-3p:j quote
people from different culture do shy just speak different language
previous issue in <unk> space one number one focus on santo feeling specifically <unk> orientation
re be lot key point to cover relate to ilo derive orientation concept
now as ix-1p-pl move on to next topic ix-1p-pl will talk specifically about telecom uprising orientation
ix-3p:j saidno well to be like <unk> but ix-1p-pl collect and <unk> deaf experience instead
but for purpose this ix-1p would like to focus on two thing
now ix-1p would like to focus on et rebel orientation
now on relate topic how do fly people sharply experience be include in that world
ix-3p:j 832 not necessary for celebration consider to be acceptable to be same all over world
in field <unk> orientation ix-3p-pl-arc have ix-3p-pl-arc own way <unk> role voice range generus range sender
some culture have more expand range evolution than or but all ix-3p-pl-arc have future expectation
re be more thing on list but ix-1p be focus here on those two with respect to acceptable guide
if re dearly no voice that means re illustration no identity
when ix-3p:j deem loud ix-3p:j can be see as lack <unk> as barbaric
ix-3p-pl-arc exceed normal voice independently which give rise to various interpretation
people make different stable that be in conflict give rise to <unk> politics
inaction make this kind judgment enter into <unk> politics
what happen in group people who have indulge pool <unk> orient way life be that ix-3p-pl-arc rule when ix-3p-pl-arc join different group break many voice
or perhaps re sharply something wrong with voice or person will be think to be slow coordinator phase
this happen when people do shy know about difference in <unk> orientation
that first <unk> have indulge pool <unk> orientation
ix-3p-pl-arc talk about <unk> vision and mast <unk> <unk> sound neoliberalism
deaf people make progress with growth sign
deaf experience have be show to be really different
ix-3p:j 832 possible to enable people to learn about different <unk>
social institution influence everything from 1.8 to education
many colleague in cultural and bolster study discuss role headquarters in today 1980 world
discussion so far n show two different <unk> erroneous in relation to development language
in gue shirin affront be now place above sound
often because judgment come from ilo coordinator oral perspective <unk> politics result in judgment break sound and visa <unk> this need sound
in ix-3p-pl-arc life all deaf people really experience <unk> sound
growth sign go in one direction horrible growth speak go in anor
