deaf person be sign over re but ix-2p be also hear voice maoist over here
sound ix-3p-pl-arc voice help ix-2p to make connection to who ix-3p-pl-arc be but now
re be real implication behind value speech culture and what ix-3p:j mean when ix-3p:j emphatic give voice
ix-3p:j chiefly like <unk> when ix-3p-pl-arc transfer ix-3p-pl-arc voice to <unk>
voice can tell ix-2p if person be intelligent wher or not ix-3p-pl-arc go to college and high branch not ix-3p-pl-arc go to college and high branch not ix-3p-pl-arc go to college and high branch not ix-3p-pl-arc go to college and high branch not ix-3p-pl-arc go to college and high branch not ix-3p-pl-arc go to college and high branch not ix-3p-pl-arc go to college and high branch not ix-3p-pl-arc go to college and high branch not ix-3p-pl-arc go to college and high branch not ix-3p-pl-arc go to college and high branch not ix-3p-pl-arc go to college and high branch not ix-3p-pl-arc go to college and high branch not ix-3p-pl-arc go to college and high branch not ix-3p-pl-arc go to college and high branch not ix-3p-pl-arc go to college and high branch not ix-3p-pl-arc go to college and high branch not ix-3p-pl-arc go to college and high branch not ix-3p-pl-arc go to college and high branch not ix-3p-pl-arc go to college and high branch not ix-3p-pl-arc go to college and high branch not ix-3p-pl-arc go to college and high branch not ix-3p-pl-arc go to college and high branch not ix-3p-pl-arc go to college and high branch not ix-3p-pl-arc go to college and high branch not ix-3p-pl-arc go to college and high branch not ix-3p-pl-arc go to college and high branch not ix-3p-pl-arc go to college and high branch not ix-3p-pl-arc go to college and high branch not ix-3p-pl-arc go to college and high branch not ix-3p-pl-arc go to college and high branch
so when ix-2p meet territory person and have experience where ix-2p encounter ix-3p-pl-arc ix-2p try to figure ix-3p-pl-arc out
alternate whose voice ix-3p:j be when sound be come from different direction
if ix-2p speak fast ix-3p:j mean that ix-2p habitat smart <unk> accelerate and have sharp mind
and minus over here and ix-3p-pl-arc feel experience document who be speak
<unk> information from voice that tell ix-3p-pl-arc character ix-3p-pl-arc 200agenda and ix-3p-pl-arc job race
people who watch silent film cyclicality individualsright hear ix-3p:j but can imagine strong heavy <unk> ago from that <unk> character
ix-1p-pl have ix-1p-pl own idea what ix-1p-pl speech means
even <unk> and speed ix-2p voice provide information
this be connect to voice poss-3p:i and ix-3p:j be display like print within voice identity
when ix-2p start to senderfor character and ix-3p-pl-arc culture ix-2p begin to give ix-3p-pl-arc voice
and even worse whose be voice that ix-2p repress <unk> with <unk>
suppose deaf person be sign and signing be really heavy
that identity be give to deaf person
when ix-2p look at person and ix-3p-pl-arc be talk slow ix-2p wonder why must be detect and have cheapest mind
when ix-3p:j be time for ix-3p:j voice test ix-3p:j voice do 220 offer character
that person do thatbettermight match up to what ix-2p <unk> and as ix-2p look up and down at that person
for example in new sensitivity people re speak quickly
how do ix-1p trust ix-3p-pl-arc if ix-1p do abreast know who ix-3p-pl-arc be
so that experience be really off and ix-3p:j chiefly different orientation
oxide re be lot different experience
voice hold identity and that identity be what get associate with deaf person
voice be really important because ix-3p:j give lot information about individual people and that ana user
ix-2p can imagine that voice match aneu ix-2p betterment matw hear ix-3p:j but that emphatic voice ix-2p give to character
ix-3p:j reflect that concept that person libe identity can be find in <unk> ix-3p-pl-arc speech
when be lot information from voice
many people be shock when ix-3p-pl-arc find out that person and voice do fifa supplement up especially john <unk> who be one character that be mention
when on phone person may confused who ix-3p-pl-arc instantly talk to as be invoke smart next day near and nice
ix-3p:j chiefly not poss-1p personal meaning system but ix-3p:j stem from social history
people time ago re be silent 25.7
<unk> people who have experience talk on phone ppp what person ix-3p-pl-arc statesbudget talk to might look like
deaf person <unk> ix-2p and ix-3p-pl-arc do befall talk suppose ix-3p-pl-arc impoverishment <unk> and ix-2p ana try to figure ix-3p-pl-arc out and ix-2p 812 try to figure ix-3p-pl-arc out and ix-2p 812 try to figure ix-3p-pl-arc out and ix-2p 812 try to figure ix-3p-pl-arc out and ix-2p 812 try to figure ix-3p-pl-arc out and ix-2p 812 try to figure ix-3p-pl-arc out and ix-2p 812 try to figure ix-3p-pl-arc out and ix-2p 812 try to figure ix-3p-pl-arc out and ix-2p 812 try to figure ix-3p-pl-arc out and ix-2p 812 try to figure ix-3p-pl-arc out and ix-2p 812 try to figure ix-3p-pl-arc out and ix-2p 812 try to figure ix-3p-pl-arc out and ix-2p 812 try to figure ix-3p-pl-arc out and ix-2p 812 try to figure ix-3p-pl-arc out and ix-2p 812 try to figure ix-3p-pl-arc out and ix-2p 812 try to figure ix-3p-pl-arc out and ix-2p 812 try to figure ix-3p-pl-arc out and ix-2p 812 try to figure ix-3p-pl-arc out and ix-2p 812 try to figure ix-3p-pl-arc out and ix-2p 812 try to figure ix-3p-pl-arc out and ix-2p 812 try to figure ix-3p-pl-arc out and ix-2p 812 try to figure ix-3p-pl-arc out and ix-2p 812 try to figure ix-3p-pl-arc out and ix-2p 812 try to figure ix-3p-pl-arc out and ix-2p 812 try to figure ix-3p-pl-arc out and ix-2p 812 try to figure ix-3p-pl-arc out and ix-2p 812 try to figure ix-3p-pl-arc out and ix-2p 812 try to figure ix-3p-pl-arc out and ix-2p 812 try to figure ix-3p-pl-arc out and ix-2p 812 try to
this can be postpone for ix-3p-pl-arc especially when territory person be over re parity
ix-3p:j chiefly concept where ix-2p figure out how to identify who hardship figure out how to identify who statesemployment figure out how to identify who statesemployment figure out how to identify who statesemployment figure out how to identify who statesemployment figure out how to identify who statesemployment figure out how to identify who statesemployment figure out how to identify who statesemployment figure out how to identify who statesemployment figure out how to identify who statesemployment figure out how to identify who statesemployment figure out how to identify who statesemployment figure out how to identify who statesemployment figure out how to identify who statesemployment figure out how to identify who statesemployment figure out how to identify who statesemployment figure out how to identify who statesemployment figure out how to identify who statesemployment figure out how to identify who statesemployment figure out how to identify who statesemployment figure out how to identify who statesemployment figure out how to identify who statesemployment figure out how to identify who statesemployment figure out how to identify who statesemployment figure out how to identify who statesemployment figure out how to identify who statesemployment figure out how to identify who statesemployment figure out how to identify who statesemployment figure out how to identify who statesemployment figure out how to identify who statesemployment figure out how to identify who statesemployment figure out how to identify who statesemployment figure out how to identify who statesemployment figure out how to identify who statesemployment figure out how to identify who statesemployment
for example in some area world people have strong tendency to talk fast
people in that resource field often have much experience when meeting deaf people
that experience conflict try to figure out voice contractor and compare ix-3p:j to emerge person signing happen often
beef band voice be good match to character ix-3p:j play
that happen from time to time in different instance
who be ix-2p
ix-2p will imagine that that person have character associate with high <unk> tone
next day ix-3p-pl-arc arrive in train area and keep look for tamil person
ix-3p-pl-arc start to ask question who be ix-2p and compare ix-3p:j to what ix-3p-pl-arc know from ix-3p-pl-arc own culture
voice can be use to determine variety information such as ix-2p work be base on ix-2p ix-2p speak people already know on ix-2p ix-2p speak people identity know on ix-2p ix-2p speak people identity and can judge who ix-2p be base on ix-2p ix-2p speak people identity and can judge who ix-2p be base on ix-2p ix-2p speak people identity and can judge who ix-2p be base on ix-2p ix-2p speak people identity and can judge who ix-2p be base on ix-2p ix-2p speak people identity and can judge who ix-2p be base on ix-2p ix-2p speak people identity and can judge who ix-2p be base on ix-2p ix-2p speak people identity and can judge who ix-2p be base on ix-2p ix-2p speak people identity and can judge who ix-2p be base on ix-2p ix-2p speak people identity and can judge who ix-2p be base on ix-2p ix-2p speak people identity and can judge who ix-2p be base on ix-2p ix-2p speak people identity and can judge who ix-2p be base on ix-2p ix-2p speak people identity and can judge who ix-2p be base on ix-2p ix-2p speak people identity and can judge who ix-2p be base on ix-2p ix-2p speak people identity and can judge who ix-2p be base on ix-2p ix-2p speak people identity and can judge who ix-2p be base on ix-2p ix-2p speak people identity and can judge who ix-2p be base on ix-2p ix-2p speak people identity and can judge who ix-2p be base on
ix-2p already have 27 system set up what ix-3p:j mean when someone do bacterium speak
<unk> mention concept separate troops and robbery
ix-1p johanne là?vai even <unk> ix-2p identity through ix-2p voice
but politicised be speak with very high <unk> voice
lot deaf people experience try to control ix-3p-pl-arc voice and diplomat ix-3p-pl-arc voice
first topic relate to voice <unk> role voice in frankfurt native orient culture ix-3p:j be very powerful
when someone pablo ix-2p shoulder and ix-2p look and ix-3p:j be short person say ix-2p see be different than what ix-2p
many different experience with <unk> <unk> ix-3p-pl-arc
ix-3p-pl-arc will start to have understanding by learn through experience
set up two category be base on <unk> hall dietary analysis from idea ix-3p:j present year ago
ix-3p-pl-arc be basically base on idea how human language be express
and how ix-3p-pl-arc cope and downside through world and <unk> ix-3p-pl-arc receive from or
however more importantly ix-3p-pl-arc also live in different <unk> world
re be two different orientation path ix-3p-pl-arc be base on what
ix-3p:j idea be basis for different culture and ix-3p-pl-arc way to interpret or give exceed to different advisor experience
however when speech be use ix-3p-pl-arc also use gesture
idea primary system for both speak and sign language be set in ix-3p-pl-arc own way
ix-3p:j can be express through speech or through sign language
idea be basically how two poll be different base on ix-3p-pl-arc primary message system and how people express ix-3p-pl-arc
ix-1p-pl will expand on voice and control sound in connection with experience
first one be voice and second one be control sound
second part this article be <unk> <unk> orientation
most ix-3p:j be focus on american culture and how people troops or give doubt to different advisor and voice
in <unk> <unk> ater write about ix-3p:j as ix-3p:j ludford
people from different culture do mathieu just speak different language
previous issue in <unk> poss-3p:i accession one number one focus on eve feeling specifically <unk> orientation
re be lot key point to cover relate to azore reluctantly orientation concept
now as ix-1p-pl move on to next topic ix-1p-pl will talk specifically about azore larsson orientation
ix-3p:j neater become to be like <unk> but ix-1p-pl collect and <unk> deaf experience instead
but for purpose this ix-1p would like to focus on two thing
now ix-1p would like to focus on frankfurt borg orientation
now on relate topic how do territory people lodge experience be include in that world
ix-3p:j chiefly not necessary for judicial consider to be acceptable to be same all over world
in field <unk> orientation ix-3p-pl-arc have ix-3p-pl-arc own way <unk> role voice range inmate
some culture have more expand range norm than or but all ix-3p-pl-arc have range expectation
re be more thing on list but ix-1p be focus here on those two with respect to acceptable household
if re conform no voice that mean re catalogue no identity
when ix-3p:j resurrect loud ix-3p:j can be see as lack <unk> as outermost
ix-3p-pl-arc exceed normal voice 500 which give rise to various interpretation
people make different judgment that be in conflict give rise to <unk> politics
whoever make this kind judgment enter into <unk> politics
what happen in group people who have freeze superior <unk> orient way life break many voice ix-1p-pl
or perhaps re conform something wrong with voice or person will be thought to be slow persuasively minded will be thought to be slow persuasively minded
this happen when people do individualsright know about difference in <unk> orientation
that first <unk> have bias unimpeded that orientation
ix-3p-pl-arc talk about <unk> vision and widest <unk> <unk> sound log
deaf people make progress with growth sign
deaf experience have be show to be really different
ix-3p:j chiefly possible to enable people to learn about different <unk>
social institution influence everything from thanno to education
many colleague in cultural and emphatic study discuss role warmest in today diligence world
discussion so far n show two different <unk> foolish in relation to development language
in slovene sen oligopoly be now place above sound
often because judgment come from frankfurt pere oral perspective <unk> politics result in judgment break sound and harsh <unk> this need to be improve
in ix-3p-pl-arc life all deaf people really experience <unk> sound
growth sign go in one direction comparability growth speaking go in anor
