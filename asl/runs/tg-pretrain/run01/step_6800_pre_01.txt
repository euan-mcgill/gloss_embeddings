deaf person be sign over re but ix-2p be also hear voice pmous over here
sound ix-3p-pl-arc voice help ix-2p to make connection to who ix-3p-pl-arc be but now
re be real implication behind value speech culture and what ix-3p:j mean when ix-3p:j proactively give voice
ix-3p:j painfully like <unk> when ix-3p-pl-arc transfer ix-3p-pl-arc voice to <unk>
voice can tell ix-2p if person be intelligent wher or not ix-3p-pl-arc go to college and wher or not ix-3p-pl-arc go to college and wher or not ix-3p-pl-arc go to college and wher or not ix-3p-pl-arc go to college and wher or not ix-3p-pl-arc go to college and wher or not ix-3p-pl-arc go to college and wher or not ix-3p-pl-arc go to college and wher or not ix-3p-pl-arc go to college and wher or not ix-3p-pl-arc go to college and wher or not ix-3p-pl-arc go to college and wher or not ix-3p-pl-arc go to college and wher or not ix-3p-pl-arc go to college and wher or not ix-3p-pl-arc go to college and wher or not ix-3p-pl-arc go to college and wher or not ix-3p-pl-arc go to college and wher or not ix-3p-pl-arc go to college and wher or not ix-3p-pl-arc go to college and wher or not ix-3p-pl-arc go to college and wher or not ix-3p-pl-arc go to college and wher or not ix-3p-pl-arc go to college and wher or not ix-3p-pl-arc go to college and wher or not ix-3p-pl-arc go to college and wher or not ix-3p-pl-arc go to college and wher or not ix-3p-pl-arc go to college and wher or not ix-3p-pl-arc go to college and wher or not ix-3p-pl-arc go to college and wher or not ix-3p-pl-arc go to college and wher or not ix-3p-pl-arc go to college and wher or not ix-3p-pl-arc go to college and wher or not ix-3p-pl-arc go to college and wher or
so when ix-2p meet deaf person and have experience where ix-2p encounter ix-3p-pl-arc and ix-3p-pl-arc do painfully talk ix-2p try to figure ix-3p-pl-arc out
convene whose voice ix-3p:j be when sound be come from different direction
if ix-2p speak fast ix-3p:j mean that ix-2p kasoulide smart <unk> smooth and have mountain mind
and stateless over here and ix-3p-pl-arc feel experience contrary who be speak
<unk> information from voice that tell ix-3p-pl-arc character ix-3p-pl-arc mess and ix-3p-pl-arc job
people who watch silent film kasoulide veld hear ix-3p:j but can imagine strong heavy <unk> voice from that <unk> knock
ix-1p-pl have ix-1p-pl own idea what ix-1p-pl speech mean
even <unk> and speed ix-2p voice provide information
this be connect to voice poss-3p:i and ix-3p:j be display like standardise within voice identity
when ix-2p start to prolong character and ix-3p-pl-arc culture ix-2p begin to give ix-3p-pl-arc voice
and even worse whose be voice that ix-2p inspiring <unk> with <unk>
suppose deaf person be sign and sign be really heavy
that identity be give to deaf person
when ix-2p look at person and ix-3p-pl-arc be talk slow ix-2p wonder why must be <unk> and have painfully and have painfully and have painfully and have painfully and have painfully and have painfully and have painfully and have painfully and have painfully and have painfully and have painfully and have painfully and have painfully and have painfully and have painfully and have painfully and have painfully and have painfully and have painfully and have painfully and have painfully and have painfully and have painfully and have painfully and have painfully and have painfully and have painfully and have painfully and have painfully and have painfully and have painfully and have painfully and have painfully and have painfully and have painfully and have painfully and have painfully and have painfully and have painfully and have painfully and have painfully and have painfully and have painfully and have painfully and have painfully and have painfully and have painfully and have painfully and have painfully and have painfully and have painfully and have painfully and have painfully and have painfully and have painfully and have painfully and have painfully and have painfully and have painfully and have painfully and have painfully and have painfully and have painfully and have painfully and have painfully and have painfully and have painfully and have painfully and have painfully and have painfully and have painfully and have painfully and have painfully and have painfully and have painfully and have painfully and have painfully and have painfully
when ix-3p:j be time for ix-3p:j voice test ix-3p:j voice do hurt match character
that person do technologically match up to what ix-2p <unk> and as ix-2p look up and down
for example in new ilo people re speak quickly
how do ix-1p trust ix-3p-pl-arc if ix-1p do painfully know who ix-3p-pl-arc be
so that experience be really off and ix-3p:j proactively different orientation
aerodrome re be lot different experience
voice hold identity and that identity be what get associate with deaf person
voice be really important because ix-3p:j give lot information about individual people and that painfully focus orientation
ix-2p can imagine that voice match clearance ix-2p kasoulide rossa hear ix-3p:j but that painfully voice ix-2p within to isolate
ix-3p:j reflect that concept that person proactively identity can be find in <unk> ix-3p-pl-arc speech
re be lot information from voice
many people be shock when ix-3p-pl-arc find out that person and voice do acutely match up especially offensive <unk> who be one achieve up especially offensive <unk> who be one achieve that especially offensive <unk> who be one achieve up especially offensive <unk> who be one achieve that especially offensive <unk> who be one achieve up especially offensive <unk> who be one achieve that especially offensive <unk> who be one achieve up especially offensive <unk> who be one achieve that especially offensive <unk> who be one achieve up especially offensive <unk> who be one achieve that especially offensive <unk> who be one achieve up especially offensive <unk> who be one achieve that especially offensive <unk> who be one achieve up especially offensive <unk> who be one achieve that especially offensive <unk> who be one achieve up especially offensive <unk> who be one achieve that especially offensive <unk> who be one achieve up especially offensive <unk> who be one achieve that especially offensive <unk> who be one achieve up especially offensive <unk> who be one achieve that especially offensive <unk> who be one achieve up especially offensive <unk> who be one achieve that especially offensive <unk> who be one achieve up especially offensive <unk> who be one achieve that especially offensive <unk> who be one achieve up especially offensive <unk> who be one achieve that especially offensive <unk> who be one achieve up especially offensive <unk> who be one achieve that especially offensive <unk> who be one achieve up especially offensive
when on phone person may indicate who ix-3p-pl-arc definitively talk to as person next day between train good look and nice
ix-3p:j painfully not poss-1p personal meaning system but ix-3p:j stem from social history
people time ago re be to be in silent proactively but n ix-3p:j change and voice be add so test
<unk> people who have experience talk on phone brutality what person ix-3p-pl-arc definitively talk to might look like
deaf person <unk> ix-2p and ix-3p-pl-arc do disguise talk ageing ix-3p-pl-arc proclaim <unk> and ix-2p definitively try to figure ix-3p-pl-arc out
this can be fewer for ix-3p-pl-arc especially when deaf person be over re workload
ix-3p:j painfully concept where ix-2p figure out how to identify who
for example in some area world people have strong tendency to talk fast
people in that orientation field often have whilst experience when meeting deaf people
that experience conflict try to figure out voice pmous and compare ix-3p:j to deaf person sign happen often
john kasoulide voice be good match to character ix-3p:j play
that happen from time to time in different instance
who be ix-2p
ix-2p will imagine that that person have knock associate with high <unk> unsatisfactory
next day ix-3p-pl-arc arrive in train area and keep look for bail person
ix-3p-pl-arc start to ask question who be ix-2p and compare ix-3p:j to what ix-3p-pl-arc know from ix-3p-pl-arc own culture
voice can be use to guinea variety information such as ix-2p work ix-2p be base on ix-2p voice speak people already know ix-2p identity and can judge who ix-2p be base on ix-2p voice speak people already know ix-2p identity and can judge who ix-2p be base on ix-2p voice speak people already know ix-2p identity and can judge who ix-2p be base on ix-2p voice speak people already know ix-2p identity and can judge who ix-2p be base on ix-2p voice speak people already know ix-2p identity and can judge who ix-2p be base on ix-2p voice speak people already know ix-2p identity and can judge who ix-2p be base on ix-2p voice speak people already know ix-2p identity and can judge who ix-2p be base on ix-2p voice speak people already know ix-2p identity and can judge who ix-2p be base on ix-2p voice speak people already know ix-2p identity and can judge who ix-2p be base on ix-2p voice speak people already know ix-2p identity and can judge who ix-2p be base on ix-2p voice speak people already know ix-2p identity and can judge who ix-2p be base on ix-2p voice speak people already know ix-2p identity and can judge who ix-2p be base on ix-2p voice speak people already know ix-2p identity and can judge who ix-2p be base on ix-2p voice speak people already know ix-2p identity and can judge who ix-2p be base on ix-2p voice speak people already know ix-2p identity and can
ix-2p already have system set up what ix-3p:j mean when someone do hurt speak
<unk> mention concept separate interpret and <unk>
ix-1p salute rossa even <unk> ix-2p identity through ix-2p voice
but pioneer be speak with very high <unk> voice
lot deaf people experience try to control ix-3p-pl-arc voice and substitute ix-3p-pl-arc voice
first topic relate to voice <unk> role voice in ilo for orient culture ix-3p:j be very powerful
when someone malign ix-2p wide and ix-2p look and ix-3p:j be short person husband and ix-2p definitively ix-1p definitively meeting
many different experience with <unk> <unk> ix-3p-pl-arc
ix-3p-pl-arc will start to have understanding by learn through experience
set up two category be base on <unk> pour dietary analysis from idea ix-3p:j present year ago
ix-3p-pl-arc be basically base on idea how human language be express
and how ix-3p-pl-arc cope and <unk> through world and <unk> ix-3p-pl-arc receive from or
however more importantly ix-3p-pl-arc also live in different <unk> world
re be two different orientation path ix-3p-pl-arc be base on what
ix-3p:j idea be basis for different culture and ix-3p-pl-arc way to interpret or give know to different <unk> experience
however when speech be use ix-3p-pl-arc also use gesture
idea primary system for both speak and sign language be set in ix-3p-pl-arc own way
ix-3p:j can be express through speech or through sign language
idea be basically how two rethink be different base on ix-3p-pl-arc primary message system and how people express ix-3p-pl-arc
ix-1p-pl will expand on voice and control sound in connection with experience
first one be voice and second one be control sound
second part this article be <unk> <unk> hamper
most ix-3p:j be focus on fiscal culture and how people interpret or give meaning to different <unk> and voice
in <unk> <unk> abbreviated write about ix-3p:j as ix-3p:j quote
people from different culture do painfully just speak different language
previous issue in <unk> boundary one number one focus on painfully feeling specifically <unk> orientation
re be lot key point to cover relate to ilo hurt orientation concept
now as ix-1p-pl move on to next topic ix-1p-pl will talk specifically about ilo notification orientation
ix-3p:j kasoulide become to be like <unk> but ix-1p-pl collect and <unk> deaf experience instead
but for purpose this ix-1p would like to focus on two thing
now ix-1p would like to focus on ilo art orientation
now on relate topic how do deaf people proactively experience be include in that world
ix-3p:j painfully not necessary for range consider to be acceptable to be same all over world
in field <unk> orientation ix-3p-pl-arc have ix-3p-pl-arc own way <unk> role voice
some culture have more expand range norm than or but all ix-3p-pl-arc have range expectation
re be more thing on list but ix-1p be focus here on those two with respect to acceptable wing
if re prioritise no voice that mean re prioritise no identity
when ix-3p:j dissolve loud ix-3p:j can be see as lack <unk> as norm
ix-3p-pl-arc exceed normal voice range which give rise to various interpretation
people make different stable that be in conflict give rise to <unk> politics
whoever make this kind judgment enter into <unk> politics
what happen in group people who have magic leakage <unk> orient way life be that ix-3p-pl-arc group
or perhaps re insecure something wrong with voice or person will be think to be slow to be slow to be slow to be slow to be slow to be slow to be slow to be slow to be slow to be slow to be slow to be slow to be slow to be slow to be slow to be slow to be slow to be slow to be slow to be slow to be slow to be slow to be slow to be slow to be slow to be slow to be slow to be slow to be slow to be slow to be slow to be slow to be slow to be slow to be slow to be slow to be slow to be slow to be slow to be slow to be slow to be slow to be slow to be slow to be slow to be slow to be slow to be slow to be slow to be slow to be slow to be slow to be slow to be slow to be slow to be slow to be slow to be slow to be slow to be slow to be slow to be slow to be slow to be slow to be slow to be slow to be slow to be slow to be slow to be slow to be slow to be slow to be slow to be slow to be slow to be slow to be slow to be slow to be slow
this happen when people do painfully know about difference in <unk> orientation
that first <unk> have magic contingency <unk> hamper
ix-3p-pl-arc talk about <unk> vision and magic <unk> <unk> sound schwarzenburg
deaf people make progress with growth sign
deaf experience have be show to be really different
ix-3p:j painfully possible to enable people to learn about different <unk>
social institution influence everything from 1.05 to education
many colleague in cultural and painfully study discuss role scientist in today workload world
discussion so far n show two different <unk> genetically in relation to development language
in 12.55 token magic be now place above sound
often because judgment come from ilo paint oral perspective <unk> politics result in judgment break sound and harsh
in ix-3p-pl-arc plan all deaf people really experience <unk> sound
growth sign go in one direction possess growth speak go in anor
