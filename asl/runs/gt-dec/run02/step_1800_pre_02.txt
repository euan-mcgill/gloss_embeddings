why is dad upset ?
really , all the way in boston , it can rain in la .
the cop said , " oh you ca n't hear ? " .
it can create an opportunity for the other team to win ,
so , let 's see , the hall coordinator is not unpredictable ! well , we were trouble .
who does the cat who start on their wedding ?
the deaf person gestured that he could n't hear . the deaf person was driving .
that dog that chased the group uses smashed ; and another group uses doors .
bob does n't know which silber , while in la it 's boston ? in la , it 's very humid and more flavorful .
does the bride and groom wrote at their wedding ? in la , it 's boston like and vegetables in california .
we had a good time to do .
there are so many things that are wrong with the system .
the deaf person gestured that he could n't hear at the deaf community .
does the student 's job pay ? outside ? no , it does n't have a big dog .
... and another guy , nurse , counselor , and social worker and started talking .
if if that is a whole accident , they 're in class , you 're going to the movies .
the early intervention services for both groups had the same checklist .
the deaf person gestured that he could n't hear at the deaf community .
... and when that was all the time , well , well , well , well , well , well , well , well , well , well , well , well , well , well , well , well , well , well , well , that was that we stayed on the road .
the deaf person said , " oh , it 's fine " and then the two cars pulled over .
... for two than seven years .
i do n't even have one dollar !
why is dad upset ? i have no idea ...
i was driving through the country .
the deaf person gestured that he could n't hear . the deaf person gestured that he could n't hear .
so , fine , the hall coordinator is big " b " word -- i do n't want to say it here in boston .
there are n't any video games . the hall coordinator was very friendly and more flavorful .
in la , the weather is farther away . here , the sun feels closer , more intense , and there is not enough rain to feed the flowers and plants .
we had a big bite to the hall coordinator .
you have to make a word involved in the deaf mentor , you ca n't believe well , you must have to use the deaf role model .
... , for example , they used to have good service , right down , and there is not enough rain to feed the flowers and pans .
i do n't have any money . i do n't have any money .
still , wow , when there 's a hurricane , my father began to arrive at the costs .
people seems like flowers and people used to buy flowers and make sure you have paper and pen ready .
the deaf person said , " you seem fine , i do n't have a deaf sister . "
how many kids does phil have ?
ask the next group did the same game , we buy ?
... for two years , for example , for two years , for example , for two years .
people are very upset and here in boston , it seems like like l.a .
so , the study dropped down . i have to admit that mexican food in la is better .
in december , it does n't rain everyday in boston . we have wonderful weather here , but if it was , they have to wait for the cop to arrive .
it 's the same idea professionals in boston .
who failed flowers ?
will if you win the lottery , will you buy ?
he would do anything for a motorcycle , like for example , he ran in the mr . deaf csun pageant .
who wants to use someone ?
... and realized that the hall coordinator is big " b " word -- i do n't want to say it here in boston .
i had to go out and clean up the grass .
the hearing person gestured that he could n't hear . the deaf person said , " oh , you 're welcome , you have been moving away .
why do n't they use a word like " identified " as in " i 've identified this child deaf " ? now it does not seem bad at all .
but in la , they did n't have any money .
the deaf person gestured that he could n't hear . they have a deaf role model .
we were lucky and half with six years old ,
the deaf person gestured , " you can copy , i have to help someone , haha .
why do you have an imac ?
does the study tonight start at 8 or 9 ? no , it wo n't be video anymore .
... for two than seven years ,
... for two than seven years .
... and then , i do n't know where to go .
but in la , they do n't have a good while .
so we ca n't care for year .
it was probably from us anyway so we went on and twenty minutes minutes , but we did n't have any sewer progress .
there are many groups with same collided . if they do n't want any to use a deaf mentor , he / she would feel fine for them .
... for example , we used to have an opportunity to move in and live with my family at the new job .
my first year ,
while in the la area , they have good service , well , well , well , and not ...
... for example , because we did n't have any money .
... and here in boston is more outside .
there are so many things that are wrong with the system .
if it 's snowing out , my ski year is cancelled .
is that videogame easy to beat ?
people are not any of them .
there are many various things . for example , the hall coordinator is big " b " word -- i do n't want to say it here in boston .
really , all the way in nebraska , it rains a lot .
... for example , because we did n't have any money .
the deaf person gestured that he could n't hear at all .
but , it 's the only thing in boston , it wo n't be expensive .
i just thought it was eleven guys hitting another eleven guys .
... for two than seven years , two , two , deaf , and both people were looking up , and two cars were talking for another next year .
if it does n't rain , there wo n't be cancelled .
there are n't any video games . if they change that , boston here in boston .
first of all , i think nothing compares with boston seafood .
... for two years , when i was a junior and then a senior in high school or two three years .
there do n't we use a deaf mentor , but the hearing man gestured that he could n't hear .
... and here in boston is that the first thing .
the cop said , " oh you ca n't hear ? " . then he thought , " why do n't i do it again "
does they think where to approach they did n't care and just drive right through .
does someone love flowers ?
... when in boston , it snows a lot in la , it 's a dry and more than seven years old , but in september , it 's a thinking game .
... or , it can create many things : it 's the same idea here in boston .
it 's the same thing . it 's the same idea here in boston .
he puts the cover back on and nails each corner .
first of all , they were six and half or four years old ,
people deaf people can not use sometimes deaf people in boston deaf mentor , deaf people in the deaf community .
the deaf person gestured that he could n't hear at the deaf community .
they do n't care and just drive about the community .
we were lucky and half with six years old ,
it is perfect , but during time it 's in boston it 's only $ 1.50 to two dollars and it is even a bigger loaf than in la .
so , since , i have lived there for around six years .
... for example , fine , right now they was six and half or four years old .
we would have bad weather here in boston area in boston it 's only $ 1.50 to two dollars and it is even a bigger loaf than in la .
i do n't care and say that the deaf person was trying to drive across the country .
in la , it gets a little bit cooler , and there is not enough rain to feed the flowers and plants .
