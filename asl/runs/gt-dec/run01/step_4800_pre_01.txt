... really , wow , it 's really inspiring . before it 's the way it involves me .
the hearing person looked and thought , " wow , he is lucky ! " .
... i had there that ? no , that 's not ?
so , the family must learn to listen to the parents and be disappointed for a deaf role model supporting the parents in rochester .
it was that ? that he drank n't care of who .

... and i grew up the raft .
jim threatened to show the mouse drink and punched him in the plane .
your of us were shocked , who we fell fell before ,
if he 's same and deaf or four years old ,
the screening shows that the baby is deaf .
she went and explained the situation . one group who found together .
it was very intimidating . the pigs would n't be dry . they had a very bit .
... and another guy , mike daisy is ready .
... for more than seven years .
i could n't believe if i see it .
so , the family really goes to the rochester institute .
i pulled the bag onto the raft .
the wolf gestured that he should n't hear .
so , we agreed with the decision and went ahead and moved south to the bathroom in the public .
... is stuck under the boat and could not breathe for a while .
in the meeting ; all people in the room are hearing .
i inhaled thought , " why do n't i have a deaf mentor , " the waitress said , " no , no ... "
the wolf threw up his finger . he and his brother asked themselves what they did n't do . they have to do more such .
... and would ask the parents to the early intervention .
there wo n't stop . that 's how bad the service is .
it 's important that the child is deaf at all o'clock .
people seem like jana toys because they both people love paper and pen , and pen .
the deaf person said , " again , he is deaf ! " . he ran away .
the clothes are on sale .

deaf people in deaf child can make him a deaf role model , but he is n't deaf .
a wolf refused . he closed and locked the door ; the deaf man looked and looked at him shocked .
he started to force the hearing person . they could do more such as being involved in the deaf community .
... and all people in the spa are cut to the joint .
... and make sure it 's still hot at seven o'clock . but it 's a guarantee that school will be closed .
we have to discuss the parents to come at the back of the raft .
ask for utah , they used different words for each group while asking them the questions .
the trees and nurse would say to the parents would be flat"--75 for the deaf community .
a deaf role model , as they used to keep ready in a dorm .
