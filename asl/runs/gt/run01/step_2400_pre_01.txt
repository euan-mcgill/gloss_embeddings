... like one side of who does n't like to make sure and have one meat .
we had a choice of steak or chicken .
it was fun all day and we had a good time .
... you know , they have different words for example .
therefore , overall , overall , there 's a missing link .
... and , make sure they have ready to new york ,
if he did n't pay for it , he told me is going to the hospital .
the classes will learn , but we deaf people can not hear him in the back .
the deaf person said , " really ? oh you know ? "
it was n't a big deal . it had a big log on it .
... i was very upset .
he keeps drinking cofffee .
in the past , when i was driving , i was really bored .
there is so many things .
i felt numb .
same idea for food shopping shopping : in the morning .
so , fine . the cop said , " no ... oh well . "
there were eight of us in the raft , and both people in front had to be hearing .
... like one side of us were lapd ...
there were eight of us in the boston , you have to send a mcdonald because it was wonderful .
like , they did n't make sure nobody they have good service , well not like good or 5 , or i do n't know ...

... like now happens in , they have watching jana toys .
so , the family must have a deaf mentor , while the family from tennessee ...
the deaf person said " no , it 's not deaf . "
the cop found the lapd that chased the baby ...
