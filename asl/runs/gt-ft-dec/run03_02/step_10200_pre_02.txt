really , i already finished behind the open intervention to which means it to be snow .
... and , she looked at the raft .
i decided to gather san 's college or never college ...
so to approach the experiences of the deaf deaf person , he did n't know what to do .
really , that 's it ?
when the metal person went on it , then it was sort of ...
... did he / she / it feel going before .
it 's mother 's driving . as we brought the side of the person , it was as if she drove there as something the same intervention .
people who were watching them ; i could n't hear it .
we have a own thing story .
i would n't be thrilled when it 's a long deal .
why did they already drive at the past corner ?
he means to spend to the fall of the person that he was just driving to new york .
and , she did to join the grief man .
if he deaf , he is really a lot .
i will approach mary to the deaf person .
why do n't they use the slow ? the slow group ?
... time the test and i was looking and just go up .
... from their grandmother who was it ?
... for example and i used to take a plastic distance .
how i thought i do n't know , i do n't know .
if it 's snowing , there were many different sizes .
i was driving with different o'clock .
the reporter was really identified . the deaf man looked and started to hear .
so , that was really far on the motorcycle so it was sort of a lot .
it was perfect , but we decided to walk but it would n't be a car . "
he would be able to use what to do .
we know about the age of the motorcycle and then went back to the car .
one of all , the people were really lazy . the next man was not hungry .
i held a lot of pots when we both sat and waited up to the winter and we agreed to be fine and we agreed to the hospital and a train there .
well , i wo n't go to the history of the deaf man .
they grabbed to bed when the movie was driving to the movies because they change the movie , and they have to communicate out of the test .
people are really driving a winter to be a story of then 3 of the tire of time
the deaf person thought , " no , i 'm deaf ! "
... is deaf , he 's ...
so , the game of the still semester where is people going at now .
... for example and then went down a while . the road tends to be hearing .
people in the major major intervention often would have a deaf mentor to meet a deaf clip .
so , that 's near right on .
he would n't hear the fire , it was as if she ran back in the raft .
... that happens to be what happened .
who was it ?
in the future , he is a doctor that is a simple pace .
there were many of us went to the hospital area that the same area was delicious and chicken .
because it 's because she was named with ?
... or , she was good and then she went to the back group .
it was a bit .
they say about the middle of the raft ; i was dumbfounded .
i ca n't even wash it .
... but she was a big pace .
there were not a deaf deal of people in front of me and they would have to be able to get out of the car .
i went back on the role of the major culture .
i decided to wash the grief person .
two of the different experiences .
they will learn and use that i use many deaf people .
... from that area from the hall group .
there will be a opportunity of how human languages .
how did they see me ?
... but it is important to get in the trunk .
... that two different motorcycles for each group .
that idea i was really using to san or rain .
... but she used to join a lot of use from a bit .
... for the back of that 's thing .
she pulled down the road " the road went down .
the idea of sure really , two different separate in the back .
all of all the boys and all the experiences to do to do .
... was on the back of his face .
this article , i was really hungry .
i was twelve and then went to the decision to sf .
she told them that i was happy in the back .
people are giving the rules of different different languages .
... was on the country on one time that i was still lazy it would still be boring .
... really , a lot involved to the party in the area .
now it 's not raining about muhammad seafood .
... anyway , the different of us would have to use information .
but i did n't for two o'clock ...
now , i went up and ended up the parents on .
... and , more than how deaf people were experiencing in the world .
it 's not sarah .
we would have to speed up to the rules of deaf rules .
... all for the back of the situation and then she had a bib .
... and then she were able to get out that i was growing up .
i was n't driving , it was identified up .
after my siren , i was really unpredictable .
i showed my heart and saw a boxing letter .
they make a bunch of making a winding while they saw a kind of ...
he made a bunch of that makes a situation to make a house .
... with the car and i grew in the back .
if my way , it was really slow thought someone was fine .
she happened about people and i did n't know about the list .
a few of them went ahead of the language and went on .
about the deaf road , vince lombardi about him had a area of fun and i decided to move up in the post office .
the deaf progress went in the deaf mentor .
still , after a deaf quiz , which there was a show .
he made to make a whole bar .
the study will be trained to gamble in the future ; it would learn and be stuck .
i would not be in the fall of the study so if they discuss in the back .
... there would be a two different orientation from growing language .
... is going to drive up now .
so , that 's kind of situation and then she had to pull him for a while .
all of a lives of deaf people , where really , it was really a big storm .
in the past , the time went down in the group .
