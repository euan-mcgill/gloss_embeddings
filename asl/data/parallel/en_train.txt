...and the cop found the situation funny--we were lucky.  we were relieved. 
a cop pointed his finger to us and said, "don't ever do that again because i drove here all the way from la for that."
erick said yes, we will have to wait for the cop to arrive.
"alright, fine," we said.  we waited for a while.  the cop arrived...
back then, there was a fine system at csun in case you caused trouble.
i was relief and it was good that we got regular and open-minded cop.
erick was supposed to fine us.
i went and explained the situation.  the hall coordinator was not friendly.
i had go to see his superior, the hall coordinator.
actually, we had to do one thing as punishment.
he decided to waive the fine because he thought it was funny.
i took the rope off the handle and peeked in the door.
"hi, i  was just teasing you," i said.
erick said, "i was worried, you know, what if i had an emergency?"
i wouldn't be able to get out, wouldn't be able to get to another building...
he asked, "why did you do that?" i didn't have an answer, and i felt bad.
he said, "you know, i called a cop.  he's coming now."
i looked at him and asked, "really? you called a cop on us?"
i didn't know it was you guys, i thought it was someone else messing with me.
really, we were trouble makers.
four of us boys lived in a dorm room.
my first year at csun.
seven years ago.
really, i had a good time because my ra was my fraternity brother.
i couldn't get out of here if i had an emergency at another building, so i had no choice.
really, i know, i am sure those who have lived in a dorm, you hate the ras.  but anyway...
we would cause problems for our ra, residence counselor, you know, the one who checks up on the dorms.
i looked at him and asked if we really had to wait for the cop to arrive.
i tended to sneak in and cause problems for another residents.
i called the cop to come and cut the rope.
one night, three of us went upstairs--we lived on second floor,
it happened one night, that we didn't care and decided to tease him.
we, roommates seven years ago, laughed and had a good time.
i rang the doorbell, and the ra started struggling to get the door open.  i rang the doorbell across the hall, and they pulled back and forth!
neither one could get out!  i was laughing hard 
i had the rope tied across the hall.  i rang the ra's doorbell.
my ra was named erick.
it was perfect--there was a good distance between the doors.
i tied the rope to the ra's door handle and to the handle of the door across the hall.
we had rope with us when we went up.
so you know, there were two doors--his, and another door right across the hall from his door.
...to go up to the third floor.  i rang the ra's doorbell
we decided to leave them; we went back down to our room for fifteen minutes, then we felt bad and decided...
they have huge grass area littered with cigarette butts that people threw on the grass.
i had to go out and clean up the grass.
we sat down and i explained to the hall coordinator.  i was hoping she would find some humor in the situation.
so, she punished us.
we sat down, and she said that she was giving us disciplinary action.
i hoped but really, the hall coordinator is big "b" word--i don't want to say it here.
our ra lived on third floor.
we gave the bag to the hall coordinator.
i gave her the bag and asked, "are you happy now?"  she said, "don't do it again"
from then on, we were good and stayed out of trouble at csun.
it was probably from us anyway so we went.  we picked them up and threw them in a bag.
the cop walked over and started talking.
there is an old story passed down through generations of deaf people
the hearing person said, "go ahead sleep" as he drove.
the deaf person said, "sure thing" and drove away.
the cop thought to himself, "whatever", and told the men, "go ahead".
"he got excused two times!", the hearing person thought.
the deaf person gestured he couldn't hear.
the cop put on his siren. when he did, the hearing man looked and pointed back.
a cop walked over to the car and started talking.
the siren flashed and the two cars pulled over.
the hearing man looked at him shocked.
the hearing person looked and thought, "wow, he is lucky!".
the hearing person thought, "i can copy and act like the deaf person".
it was long drive and the deaf person was tired.
they communicated fine through gesture and chatted a bit as they drove.
the hearing person thought "wow, he got excused!".
the cop walked over to the car and started talking.
the hearing man wondered whether  deaf people can drive.
the deaf man said, with confidence, "it's ok" and then the two cars pulled over.
another cop pulled them over.
as he drove, he saw a person hitchhiking.
sure enough, a cop began following the car.
the deaf person continued driving and started to speed again.
sure enough, a police car pulled up behind them.
as the deaf man drove, he started to speed up.
a deaf man was driving alone.
the man pulled over.
the deaf person tapped the hearing person's shoulder and asked if he would mind switching.
he thought to himself "why don't i have him join me to chat and keep me company or something."
the car started to speed up to 90.  the hearing person looked at the meter and thought "wow!".
the cop said, "oh i see! my parents are deaf".
hearing person said, "ok, thats fine." they switched seats.
he drove for a long time.
the hearing man started to get nervous and kept looking at the speedometer.
the hearing man got into the car, the deaf man began driving.
he was hearing, the person who's hitchhiking.  the deaf person looked over...
the hearing person decided to go ahead and speed up.
the deaf man asked the hearing man "where are you going?" the hearing man tried to use gesture to explain.
the hearing person gestured that he couldn't hear.
the hearing person was excited. he ran over to the car and started talking.
as he drove across the country,  he started to feel bored while driving.
the deaf person said, "you seem fine, i am going to sleep."
the cop thought, "nah" and said, "go ahead."
"i am a fluent signer," the cop said, and started signing.
the deaf man turned to the cop and gestured that he couldn't hear.
the hearing man was shocked the cop could sign and he knew that he had been caught!
the hearing person didn't care and got into the car.
the cop said, "oh you can't hear?". then he thought, "how can i communicate with him?".  
the deaf man indicated he couldn't hear.
i saw the deer but it was too late.
i remember a while ago, i was driving...
i went ahead and got back on 80.
the deer looked at me and then moved on to cross the road.
...a big pile of grass that looked delicious!
i pulled the car onto route 80.
the deer saw, across the road...
the car swerved off the road.
the headlights got closer and closer to the deer.
it happened that, far down the road...
...there was a deer.
i caught my breath.  it had been a close call. 
seeing that, the deer decided to walk across the road.
i swerved and slammed on the brakes; the headlights shone right in the deer's face.
my car was in the middle of the road, angled perpendicular to the road.  i didn't know which direction i had been going!
the deer was in shock and scared.
i was driving through beautiful hills.
i drove up the hill with my headlights on.
i wasn't sure which way to go.
i thought "why don't i just drive on". 
...over a hill...
the flat road was boring but at least it was safe!
as i drove, the deer turned and looked at me.
i was driving for a long time.
my heart was beating really fast.
i noticed some animal crossing the road.
i was enjoying the drive.
occasionally, i would pass a house or two.
i was driving across the u.s.
as i was driving i thought "why don't i turn off the road."
i was trying to gain control of the car as it swerved.
as i was driving, i was really bored. so i started thinking about what i could do.
with the headlights on, i kept driving. 
i drove really slowly.
the car spun.
i swerved hard, right before i was about to hit the deer.
it started to get dark, so i turned on the headlights. 
i turned off the road at the exit.
the road was very dry and plain.
my heart was pounding.
i drove the car along the road.
i decided to head down one of the ways.
i was driving through the country.
(i was) on interstate 80, the one that goes straight across the country. 
as i held the wheel, i thought to myself "wow". then i looked back at the road.
the deer was frozen in shock.
i saw a sign up ahead.
the deer was eating grass.
it was for route 80.  i saw it.
i looked and saw an exit ahead.
the deer stopped eating grass and looked up.
i drove along the curvy two-lane highway.
in la, the service is awful; some people can't speak english.
here (in boston), they have good service, well not 100 percent of time but you tend to get good service---they make sure you're comfortable. 
its same kind of situation in food markets, restaurants, banks, and many different places.
people go too far:  they use umbrellas, wear rain coats, and put boots and pants on.
even if it is just barely raining--like a few drops.  i remember one day... 
while in la, its better and perfect because of no rain.
well, it rains once a while.  the funny thing about when it rains in la...
i noticed many people were looking at me like i was a complete idiot.  really, i didn't know what the big deal was.
i would go to class on my rollerblades, in shorts and a tank top, you know, like a basketball jersey. 
there was a bit of rain as i rollerbladed. 
... la would flood for sure.
there would be flooding.  if a whole year's worth of boston's rain were given to la,...
oh well.  wow--one negative thing about la is that in la, they didn't have any sewer systems.
i thought the weather was nice, a little rainy but it was nothing.  people were wearing long sleeves!
i think its probably because la is big so they didnt really care about community as much as bostonians do.
i would write something down but they still wouldn't understand me.  that's how bad the service is in la!
people were not very outgoing, friendly, welcoming in the community.
i decided to check the price.  i see the price tag: 350 dollars.  really, 350 dollars for a shirt?!
in one store, i was looking at this really nice silk shirt.
still, wow, it is very expensive in la.
i would say the most expensive shirt here in boston is up to maybe 100, 150 dollars.  i wouldn't know--i don't buy expensive shirts, but hey.
but here in boston, the weather is really unpredictable.  it could be rainy, hot, cold or cool.
there are many various things (in boston weather), but one thing i notice about la...
...and here in boston is that the fall, in september, seems about the same.
i would notice once when the leaves change color, and some start to fall off and grass is really green.  
it is perfect, but during the fall in la, it still looks like summer.  it is still very hot.
the grass is a little bit brownish because of too much sun, and there is not enough rain to feed the flowers and plants.
in december in boston, of course it snows, gets colder and the leaves fall off the trees, leaving them "naked." 
in la, it gets a little bit cooler,  but at same time it is still hot.
there are many things to compare.  for example, boston's food is delicious and better (than la).
i went to la after finishing high school.  i went to college at csun, calfornia state university at northridge. i went in '96.
i was born and raised in boston.
i am going to compare two different cities, boston and los angeles. 
the farm system in california is more outside because it is too hot to have it inside.
to most bostonians who are in la it still feels hot, 70 to 75 degrees.
third, the fruits and vegetables in california taste fresher, since they grow in california.
... is not great.  however, maybe they have better dairy products. i don't know.
i have to admit that during spring time in boston, it rains a lot.
first of all, i think nothing compares with boston seafood. second, the meat here is fresh and more flavorful.  california meat...
the sun still shines warmly, but during night time, it gets a little cooler.
same idea for food shopping: in la, a loaf of bread costs 3 or 4 bucks while here in boston it's only $1.50 to two dollars and it is even a bigger loaf than in la.
really, i'm not just talking about just economic differences, but rather cultural differences as well.
so, let's see, what else is on the list...i have to admit that mexican food in la is better.
bostonians seem more friendly in general.
outside it's still hot and dry, but it's still easier to grow crops in the l.a. area.
for example: here, when i'm driving, and two cars come up to the same intersection,
i would wave the other person on, he would say "thanks!" and wave back.
but in la, would they do that? no--they don't care and just drive right through.
a few times while i was in la, i waved people on.  i thought they would say thanks back, but the other drivers just ignored me and zipped across.  i said, "oh, you're welcome, too. oh well," and drove on. 
still, i hope that boston could give la a good example of cohesiveness
you have to make a name for yourself before you join the "elite" clubs.
but in the la area or north, well really mostly in la area, there are many smaller cliques.
people make sure to keep in touch. even if you dislike someone, we say "ah, forget it" and welcome him because we would feel bad otherwise.
of course, boston has four different seasons.
wow, there is a really big difference socially--in boston deaf culture, everyone mixes together as if we were from the same family.
well, that is what i learned in l.a.
other than food, i can compare the two environments.
...or anywhere else. the state is very strict about chemicals. they want to make sure everything runs smoothly.
i have never heard of that kind of situation here in boston.
the same policy goes for sheep. on interstate 5 at one of the stops....
they will stop and make sure no one brings in any fruits or vegetables from mexico.
there isn't any mexican food in the boston area.  it's not bad, but i don't really care for mexican food anyway. if you like mexican food though you should take advantage of it in l.a. where it's delicious.
there are very strict policies on fruit, and vegetables in california.
in la, the weather tends to be "flat"--75 or 80 degrees, sunny and dry, every day.
while in la, they only have one or two seasons.  
i don't buy it.  oh, and la is very fancy and high-class.
like for an example, when i went to beverly hills...
but in the la area, they didn't see that way.
they say, "if you are my kind, come with me; if you're not--get outta here."  they pick and choose.
no matter who we are, it is important to have diversity in the group.
it's the same thing with siberian tigers--their stripes vary.  it's the same idea here in boston.
in northridge, it tends to be ten to fifteen degrees hotter than la.
the sun is more intense here, while in la it's dry, but it's 100 to 110 degrees.
here (in boston) it could rain every day and people would still live through it without a problem. 
why? because they have a better sewer system in boston to drain water.
another thing: in the summer, it's very humid here.
but of course, it doesn't rain everyday in boston.  we have wonderful weather here.
of course, it's because l.a. is near the mexican border. 
really, it's a big difference from here.
if it's 80 degrees here in boston, it can feel really hot.  but in la, 80 degrees feels like nothing.
in la, the sun is farther away.  here, the sun feels closer, more intense, because the seasons change.  that's all for that...
...other than weather, we can also talk about boston culture and la culture.
if you see on weather channel, you will notice that if its 85 degrees in la, that means 100 degrees in northridge.
the teacher is at the movies. 
after the movie ends, the teacher will buy a book to give to the student to read.
"i don't want you to run to the fans and cheer.
"i want you to come back and sit down where you belong.
"i don't want to see you dance,
"i don't want to see you scream
reading the book, that kind of...
"...and wait until it's your turn to play again."
what motivating words vince lombardi used!  
personally, i think i'm a better coach than a player...
so i decided to play high school football.  
i just thought it was eleven guys hitting another eleven guys. 
i never realized that football could have that much emotion involved.  
they didn't care about money: back in the 50s and 60s, football...
...really, football players now make millions of dollars.  
before, they used to play for food, or for, i don't even know...
it was the same as any regular life--later they would work at the post office, or, i don't know...
...so that, vince lombardi--i remember his special speech...  
...before facing the oakland raiders in the first super bowl.  
he came in and told his men: 
"i don't want to see any end zone...
it's eleven on eleven; players on the two teams match up in the competition.
it is really inspiring.  it involves many things:
...is my favorite sport.  
really, football...
there are many different options: they can pass to the wide receiver, 
"...celebrations when you score a touchdown.
...the quarterback, who has the running back behind him.  
the offense picks a bunch of guys who weigh 300, 350 pounds to block...
"i want to see you put the ball down on the ground...
one team has the offensive line...
"i want to see, once you're in that end zone, 
they can throw to the tight end, maybe, or, i don't know...
or they can hand off to the running back, 
vince lombardi, before his men walked onto the field, 
...or, i don't know, really many other things.  it's the same idea as in chess: it's a thinking game
it could be, i don't know, a quarterback sack, 
...it can create a fumble,  
i really was engrossed by football.  he, ...
it can create an opportunity for the other team to win, 
...i didn't know much about football untill my mom gave me that book.
i remember i was young.  it was my first book i read...
my mother bought me a book written by vince lombardi.  
really, up until then, as i was growing up, i...
...i mean, unless you use your helmet to hit someone, but...
really, i've been thinking it reminds me of who really made me get interested in football.  
really, i find that to be a very amazing challenge. 
especially when football is the only legal sport where you can hit someone that hard and not get fined for it.  
he made sure his players would "give it all. "
...vince lombardi, was really a winner.
...he told his men, "hey, remember: winning isn't everything--
it's the only thing.  
he said, "men, we must march into that end zone...
...this is really my favorite quote.  before that super bowl game,
i enjoy the hits--i enjoy the pain sometimes, i admit, but, uh...
...but at the same time i love to play.  
really, vince lombardi told his men...
...not all the time.  like my hand, haha--no, not like that. 
...they can get creative, mix it up.  really, after a thousand plays, you can be creative during the game. 
"then hit, and hit, and hit!"
i know, it seems like three simple words, "hit and hit and hit," 
but when a hit is made in football, 
...it can create many things.  
"...and then come back and wait until it's your turn," just like i said before

the reporter asked ali's wife if he was alright.
he died way back, when i was around 8 years old.
he tends to shake sometimes and he had a hard time trying to focus on things. 
i wish he and i could have watched it together. 
he started to really shake and the reporter got scared.  he wasn't sure how to approach that kind of situation.
he scared the reporter, his wife was great...wow.
the reporter asked muhammad ali a simple question.
so, after that, i wish i could tell my grandfather that story.
ali started to...  well, you know he has parkinson's disease...
while they had dinner, the sports reporter collected more information about muhammad ail.
his wife cooked and got things ready for dinner.  then, they all sat down and talked.
after i watched that story, muhammad ali became my favorite boxer.
his wife invited a reporter over their house.
sometimes he  imagines he is still boxing in the ring,
his wife said "well, sort of... sometimes he has bad dreams."
...still taking punches.  sometimes he will stand up and start swinging his fists.
the reporter said, "really, muhammad ali would stand up and start punching at people?"
the wife said "yes, i have seen him beating up one man for no reason"
the reporter said, "really?" as he looked at muhammad ali.
ali was sitting, shaking; then he got up slowly and started punching the air.
ali walked toward the reporter, grabbed him by the collar, pulled him close, and shook his fist in the reporter's face. 
the reporter was really scared.  muhammad ali put him back in his seat, and said, "i am just teasing, don't worry!"
he laughed and sat down.  i had goose bumps on my arms.
i don't remember it well because i was too young but....
he asked me to sit down and watch boxing.  i didn't really get it.
it was a show about his life story. i was completely fascinated by it.
my grandfather was a big boxing fan.
in the past, when i was four or five years old...
i was not laughing, yes i know it was funny, but i got goose bumps on my arms.
i would work out and have great abdominal muscles on my stomach.  wow--it would require a lot of time, though,
as i watched, i thought to myself, "i wouldn't mind doing boxing in the future".
 but he still, uh, he still is able to find humor in many things.
i said "oh, i see," then i began watching the boxing on tv.
...because muhammad ali has parkinson's disease...
my father told me that i used to love boxing when i was growing up.
last year, i watched a story about muhammad ali on cnn.
...so i dropped it.  one thing that hit me when i was watching tv...
i opened the menu; the choices were limited, but we let it slide. 
the food was not good, so we just left it. 
the tables and chairs were all wood.  it looked like a log cabin. 
i told the waitress that i was unsatified with the food and that we'd pay for the drinks. 
we were uneasy,  but we said "ok, fine," and the three of us sat down around a table. 
really, i would have preferred a mcdonald's burger--they're better than this one was.  oh well.  
i went in; the place was really creepy. 
i took a bite... it was gross.  we all decided, "forget it."
there were no waiters...
i kept driving.  i hurried because i knew there would be a mcdonald's on the road.  we found a mcdonald's right near the end of nebraska. 
my friend said "nah, its better to pull over." "okay, fine," i said, "i'd be happy to." i said sarcastically.  we pulled over. 
we went into a restaurant.  i was hungry because i hadn't eaten lunch yet. 
the waitress said, "are you sure? do you want anything else?"  i said, "nah, i've decided to take off."
"be patient, we'll drive together, and the rain will dissipate." i said.
we left.  as we were driving, we were really hungry.
it is important to escape the big storm.
the waitress came over.  i told her that i'm deaf. 
we decided to have hamburger and french fries, something simple.
i kept on driving. i was going 85, 88, 90 mph all the way through there. 
we wnt straight on through indiana, then illinois, no--first illinois, then indiana.  it was a good drive; i kept going overnight. 
then i drove straight through iowa...i think it was iowa...yes, it was iowa.  
i thought,"perfect!" we pulled off and took the opportunity to eat at mcdonalds.  
we were lucky and took advantage of it.  after we drove a good while we decided to stop in illinois. 
there were no cops.  the speed limit there is 75 mph, so...
we stayed overnight.   let's stop, and put this aside. 
the waitress came up and talked into my ear.
i gestured, "no, i'm deaf!"  so she came around and started talking right in my face.  i said, "no, no--move back."
i wrote to explain that deaf people can read lips. 
really, some can read lips and some communicate with paper and pen.  
the waitress said, "oh.  which do you prefer?"  i said i wanted paper and pen, haha. 
because that waitress was really hard to understand. 
...anyway, i wrote that i wanted a burger with fries, just simple...cooked medium..
my friends did the same.  they both wrote down their orders, we gave the waitress the paper, and off she went. 
i couldn't chat as i was driving.
i was disappointed--you know this, my pager?  it didn't work all the way through nebraska. 
i told them its important to go slowly, 45 or 50 mph. 
really, all the way through nebraska...
after i explained wyoming, the tons of cows and all that...
we waited and waited.  the rain stopped; i said, "oh, good."
i didn't realize that nebraska was really that big! but anyway, so i was driving...
"really, it's about 500 miles across nebraska."
the food finally came.  i looked again--it had plain wonder bread for a bun and a tiny little burger.  
...it's really far to omaha--it's the end of nebraska
i was in a hurry for the food to arrive--i wanted to take advantage of the good weather for driving, but it didn't work out that way.  we waited and waited and waited. 
"really, i was driving alone.  my two friends were driving in front of me.  so i drove..."
my friends in front of me wanted to pull over.
all of sudden, a strong storm hit.  i was a bit nervous driving through it.

she said, "so you know, mike's really hearing.  he's not deaf."  
my parents asked "how do you know?"
dana saw this and saw that i was obviously hearing. 
she was disappointed and walked over to tell my parents.
she told them that i had woken up and cried
dana said," i went down and got some pots and pans...
...and i banged them together as he was sleeping."
she decided to do something else.
dana was still upset that i wasn't d-, well, that i wasn't deaf.  
the next day, i woke up.
my parents said, "really? oh well."
then they would find out if i'm deaf.
dana was impatient.  she said, "can we ask the doctor?"
my mother said, "enough! cut it out."
that first night they brought me home...
...i arrived home....
...i was sleeping in the crib.
dana was watching me.  she was mischevious, dana was--same as me growing up.  
but anyway, dana decided to gather some pots and pans.
i have an older sister.
my parents gave birth to dana.
...i had become, or had found out that i had become deaf.  
really, maybe you want to know why...
said that she want to have a deaf sister.
while my parents were sleeping, she snuck downstairs...
dana wanted a deaf sister.
my mother got pregnant with me.
she started banging the pots!  i woke up and started crying. 
when she was three and half or four years old,
she pulled a bunch of pots from the cabinet and went back upstairs to my room.
"i hope, i hope, i hope," she said.  
she would tell my mother everyday "i want a deaf sister."
i was definitely deaf.
so my mother told dana...
i did not even hear it.
she screamed my name into my ear. 
my mother said, "we can't tell if he is deaf, but if he is... that's the way it goes... "
she talked into my ears and i didn't pay attention.
when dana found out that i was boy, she found accepted it. 
but it was important that i was deaf. 
my mother said "we will see."
the time came--i was (finally) born. 
maybe it is a boy too.
my sister said "no, i don't have that feeling; i will get a deaf sister."
maybe the baby will be hearing, but we'll still love it the same. 
"but i'm hoping that it's deaf, too."
wait until he gets bigger and feels comfortable at home.
after (the baby) is born, you have to...
i am sure she is still telling many strangers about me.
...about how she found out that i had become deaf.
even today, dana still tells everyone.
right now she's in europe...
"you have a deaf brother." 
dana was jumping around, she was so excited.
dana walked around behind me screamed.
but anyway i was sitting...
i was in my high chair. 
really, i was sitting...
i have a picture, it's cute.
you know, where (babies) sit when they're eating...it has a tray.  i had a bib on...
my mother told her to take it easy, said "we'll see... "
and my mother saw the whole thing.
my  mother just stared.
she walked over to dana and said, "maybe he is deaf."
she was looking at me.
i didn't even look back.  
he sent a reply back to me with one simple sentence: "what is a car?"
so far, his motorcycles have been stolen, crashed, and so on, you know?
he had made a videotape of himself riding on one wheel at 80 mph!! he is crazy!!
motorcycling--wow.  since i care about him, i decided to send him an email.
i said to paul in the email, "you know, you have been a good friend of mine".
three of his motorcycles were stolen, two others crashed.  he has had a total of five different motorcycles. 
he would do anything for a motorcycle.  i feel sorry for him, he has bad luck with motorcycles.  
he is a real motorcycle freak.  he has a beautiful motorcycle.
he showed (the whole accident) on tape. he didn't win though, but hey.
i have a good friend of mine named paul.
he decided to force himself to ride on one wheel of the motorcycle.
he would do anything for a motorcycle, like for example, he ran in the mr. deaf csun pageant.
...from a motorcycle accident.
you know where he is now? in the hospital with broken ribs...
he fell off the motorcycle, separated his shoulder, sprained both his knee and ankle, and burned the side of his face.
he was riding the motorcycle on one wheel at 80 to 90 mph and hit a rock.

they hit me twice with the nightstick and punched me in the eye.  
i was in shock.
...i was planning to tell them i'm deaf.  as i raised my arm to sign "deaf,"...
they grabbed my arm and bent it behind my back.
because i was so shocked that i, i don't know.
why did they hit me? i didnt feel anything!
i felt numb.
they ignored me.
i tried to tell the cop that i'm deaf.  i spoke, "deaf, deaf!"
then they grabbed my hands and handcuffed me.  i was under arrest.  
what did the cop hit me for?
they were lapd, and were coming up running. 
i thought "what's going on?"
really, i wasnt sure.
why are they chasing me? i asked myself.  
i thought it was because they saw me going to the bathroom in public or something.
i thought it should be fine, i told myself to think positive about this situation.
so i...
maybe i could just let them know and say that i was sorry for going to the bathroom in the public.
she had a party.
one girl who lived right next to me.
four years ago at california state university northridge...
(this is a story of) one of my worst experiences.
it wouldn't be a big deal.  oh, it's important to inform people i'm deaf, too.
...at the nearby market. 
i decided to go buy cigarettes.
two cops walked toward me.  when they were really close to me...
 it was good time.  all night i enjoyed myself.
it is a very important thing to do.
...for us college students to get together.
i walked  to the market.
i'd say it was only five minutes away walking--practically nothing. 
i pulled a cigarette from my pants pocket and lit up.
then i walked back out from behind the bush.
i was relieved, because it was important that nobody see me.  
i looked around to make sure nobody saw me.
i looked around and everything was fine, so i went ahead and used the "bathroom." 
...i saw a bush.
i looked at it and thought, "so what!?" i went around the bush.
i admit, i had to go to the bathroom real bad. 
i couldn't hold my bladder, so i...
i was looking back and saw two cops running.
i looked back.
take rodney king, for example.  
because i felt it would be their word against mine. 
you probably wondering why i didn't report it to the police.
that's something that i hope the lapd will learn
but the hands behind the back, never again!
so he can communicate, either writing or by signing.  
or, if they really need to arrest someone, cuff him with his hands in front of his body...
if something happens and they show up, they should make sure they have paper and pen ready.
i felt fine and just forgot about it.
... to make sure they will approach deaf people in right way.
but, from now on, lapd should really teach their officers...
but anyway, my friend said "calm down, it's alright."
...did he hit me?  i had a bad headache next morning
i had a big bruise near my eye.  why...
i was really upset.
he said, "make sure not to pee in public again!" then he left.
i was ticked, but i decided to ingore him. 
"you never know if he'll have to go to the hospital tonight."
the cop told my friend, "make sure you keep an eye on him overnight."
so, fine.  the cop said...
i bought the cigarettes, put them in my pocket, and walked back.
...like one side of me felt like hitting the cop.
but, of course i couldn't do that.
"you will be wasting your time!"  they were talking back and forth.
i would look bad, and plus...
my friend looked at him and said "oh, no, no..."
i was drinking underage, too.
he said, "to pump out his stomach."
really, i admit, i didn't want to bring up...
...that i went to the bathroom in public--i didn't want that on the record. 
they have it on tape, beating him up.  
but, they still took lapd's word against rodney king's.
he took off the handcuffs.
he pushed me and i fell to the ground.
he said, "no, no."  the cop was just looked at him and shook his head 'no'.
he was looking and then finally, he was willing...
i was confused, really i felt many different things at once.
really, i felt...
i fell--what was that?! then i got up.
of course, i was very upset.
"...i saw him put something in his mouth"
the cop said, "no...
how could they guess that?
i couldn't believe it!  i said to myself, "oh my god!"
then it struck me: i had pulled the cigarette from my pocket and put it to my mouth. 
they thought i was popping a pill, i don't know.
but i tried to tell my friend that i was just smoking a cigarette.
my friend said "oh," and informed the cop that i was smoking a cigarette.
maybe you misunderstood and thought he was taking something.
the cop said, "no, i saw it very clearly."
"i will take him to the hospital now."
the cop looked at my friend and pulled me out of the car.
he said, "hey, hey, i know him!  i know mike, the one in the car."
he saw me in the cop car.  
my friend came downstairs and went outside.
some of my friends said, "really?"
my friend looked over incredulously.
he knew that i never take drugs.
then my friend asked what was going on.
the cop looked at my friend and said, "he took drugs."
i was really lucky my friend came in time. 
the cop pulled me out of the car...
i thought--i didn't know, it could have been.
really, i ended up getting arrested for that?
i had no clue of what was going on.
they grabbed me and led me off.  i didn't know what to do. 
i really thought it was maybe because i went to the bathroom in the public.
why would the  cop arrest me?
while they brought me to the cruiser, one girl who was ready to go home...
...saw the whole thing.
she went back up to the party and informed some of my friends...
...that i had been arrested by the police.
i expected they would put me in the cruiser.
...you know, they have different buildings for different wards.  i went in and waited some more.
my hand kept bleeding and i was still waiting. 
i sat down and waited for a long time.  finally, i went in. 
i was in the fast express care of the emergency area of the hospital.
he looked at my finger and said he would like to call for a second opinion.
a doctor came in, he was new and had just joined the staff.
i was a bit nervous--i trust young doctors, but would prefer an older one;  it doesn't matter though, it was fine.
i hoped my finger wouldn't become dry (the blood) or whatever. so i kept waiting. 
i still hadn't gotten my stitches.
i arrived there at two o'clock and it was already like 4:30 or 5 o'clock...
i thought "ugh" and ended up waiting again. 
i picked up the shampoo bottle and dumped it on my hand.  right after i poured it, it hit me that i couldn't use that hand. 
while the water was running, i tried to wash myself as best i could--i couldn't use my injured hand.
i went and got another bag to put on my hand.
i wasn't thinking.   now shampoo was oozing all over my hand.  geez. 
i told my boss that i had to go to the hospital because i needed stitches.
i thought to myself "fine" and went off to the hospital.
a thought struck me; i pulled out my wallet and opened it...
...i realized i didn't have my insurance information with me.
so we pulled over to a pay phone and tony called the boss
the boss said his company would cover the costs for stitches on my finger and everything.
my boss said, "yes, go ahead and use my name." i was relieved.
if he didn't pay for it then i don't know what i would have done!
we were working, doing landscaping.
tony and i grew up best friends.
yesterday, i worked with my friend.
i am sure you noticed this bandage on my hand and wonder what happened.
my boss is pretty strict.
they maybe would have to send the bill to my parents. my parents wouldn't be very happy.
there was many different sizes.
the metal corner was really sharp! it had a big log on it.
we sat down with them to give information about the insurance, my birth date, my social security number, etc. 
we were cutting wood using a cutting tool that had a metal edge.
i went to the hospital, but you know how hospitals are, they tend to keep you waiting forever!
then i got back into the shower and washed up. it felt so good!
then, i went to bed for the night to get ready to work all day today.
i worked at a quick pace.
he told us we must finish everything before sunset.
he gave me instructions; he told me, "you cannot get it wet."
after he finished, he wrapped up my finger.
...that's kind of how the stitching felt.   
i could feel the stitches being pulled through--it felt like when you tie your shoes...
i thought maybe i could just bandage it and put pressure on it so it wouldn't bleed anymore.
my hand became numb, and he stitched it.
i showed him my hand--it was bleeding profusely.
tony said that i should go to the hospital and i asked, "are you sure?"
it was not first time someone cut his finger with that same machine.
anyway, i tapped tony and told him the bad news.
when the metal corner sliced my hand, really, wow!
it looked like my fingers had been cut off!
i tried to catch it.
i got the log but the metal corner hit my hand.
so i decided go to the hospital.
i was holding my hand but it still bled through my shirt.  can you imagine that?
so anyway, i went in the shower--i had put two bags on my hand to be safe.
i wrapped my hand and the bag with a rubber band and walked into the shower.
i finally arrived home around 7:30.  i was beat.
really, i had to take shower because i had been working all day, plus i had blood all over me.
then, when you shower, you will need to use a plastic bag to cover your hand.
after he explained everything that i needed to do, i said "fine, alright then".
my x-ray result showed that my finger was cut to the joint. 
he wanted to check if i had some air in my finger which could cause an infection.
i felt funny because a plastic surgeon was going to give me the stitches.
finally, an older man came in; he was a plastic surgeon.
but all the same, he told me i better go downstairs and get an x-ray.
i thought some regular doctor, nurse, or even doctor's assistant could do it.
there was one big log that i picked up but then i started to drop it.
i went back upstairs to give the plastic surgeon my x-ray results. 
finally, he said we were ready.  he set everything up.
he got the scissors, the needle, and the string.  i saw the needle and the thick string and thought "whoa!"
he gave my hand a few injections. 
he said i was very lucky that my finger was not cut more or i would have lost it.  i was relieved!
the donut tire only lasts for 50 miles so i really had to pull over soon.  we finally arrived at the hotel. we gambled all night and we didn't sleep at all! 
and, make sure you have everything ready--make sure your car is ready before you leave, like i didn't do. 
in the morning. however, as i was driving, i found one hotel, but it had a casino too.
my friends were driving in front of me and i waved to get their attention.  i told them that we really had to stay at the hotel because it's our only choice. 
after my trip, it was six days total.  
i changed the tire. the tire was a donut tire that is only supposed to last for 50 miles.
i really enjoyed the trip and it was a wonderful time.  it was a lot of fun and i would recommend it to anyone who wants to drive across the country. if so, you can ask me for advice.
and, it's like 11 o'clock at night--everything was closed.  i just had to find a place to stay and have the car fixed the next morning. 
i started to realize that i had a spare tire in the trunk so it was a good thing that i brought it with me. 
i rummaged in the trunk.  i admit that it was my first time changing a tire. i know all men should know how, but unfortunately, i didn't.
my friends were driving in front of me and i was following them.  i had to get their attention by waving my hand so i could pull their car over.
as i got out of my car, i looked at the back of my car and saw one of the tires was flat. the tire literally blew out in two pieces! it was all gone!
it won't open til 9 or 10 in the morning.  we were okay with it even though we had to wait for a bit. the mechanic finally opened and they fixed the tire.
i had to put up and stay up til six or seven in the morning.  i was hoping that gas station would be open by then, since i needed my tire fixed before i went on to boston.
plus an oil change at the same time, which i said was fine. the oil change went fine, but the mechanic said he had some bad news for me. the engine belt had cracked and i needed a new one.
we stayed at the shop for another three hours while they were replacing the belt in the engine along with a oil change and the tire as well. i waited for a long while and finally left nevada at around12.
when we entered utah, we all were exhausted as we didn't sleep at all.  we were awake all night at the casino at nevada last night. 
we decided to continue driving and we got to colorado. we stayed at a place there because it was late. we woke up late because we wanted to catch up on our sleep.
i woke up and realized that driving to boston from la in four days was impossible.  really, i applaud anyone who drives from la to boston.
to drive across the country in four days, you would have to drive about fifteen hours each day to have the right pace to arrive in boston on time.
i drove through wymoing and nebraska. both states were very boring. it was just flat, with cows, etc. 
in wyoming--this just popped into my head--there was a place with ten thousands cows fenced in. it was sort of a small jail.
we went on a trip to san francisco.  we enjoyed it so much and sf is a beautiful city. 
i drove from la to sf to visit a good friend of mine there.
when we were getting ready to get out of nevada, i felt something on the back of my car. all of a sudden, the car dropped down in the back and was skidding.
my two friends joined and we decided to drive to boston.
after i finished the past semester at csun......
i looked at cows while i was driving and i felt sad for them because they couldn't even move. at end of the "jail", i saw a butcher shop where they were slaughtering the cows. i also saw some dead cows that were hanging!
as my frends and i were driving through the state of nevada, the three of us were really tempted to gamble. so, we decided to stop by at a casino on the border between nevada and california.
i was on i-80 all the way across the country and then i eventually got on i-90.  i expected that it would take me maybe three or four days to drive across the country. unfortunately, i was wrong!
i drove, and it was flat and plain through iowa, ohio, and illinois i got to new york, and finally i arrived boston.
i drove straight across the country from sf.
that's so typical of wymoning. we probably get our meat from there. very good meat, too, because i ate a steak there.
i have to admit that sf copies boston a little, but anyway...
we hoped to get out of nevada soon so we wouldn't feel tempted to gamble again because we all had lost some money from gambling.  
i pulled the car over.  we gambled. i had a good time for maybe a couple of hours and then i got back into the car. 
did john read the book?  when?

there was waving while we were rowing, and people fell off the raft.
it was fun all day and we had a good time.  we decided to take a break.
i realized it was serious business.
i dug my foot into the side of the raft so i wouldn't fall again.
i went for the steak--i love steak.  we ate quickly, 
we pulled over for a lunch break.
we had a choice of steak or chicken.
he expected a bunch of us to fall out.
he warned us that later, further down, would be be tougher.
the raft headed down the river.  the man in the back, our leader,... 
...and when that was done we got on the raft again
the boat was really slow.  i thought, no problem.
i was rowing and thought it was boring.
i tapped my friend tony.
i tapped him and said, "that's white water rafting?"
the boat suddenly shot down; the rapids were churning all around us.
i flew out of the raft--i was dumbfounded.
i was lost--i couldn't find the boat.  the boat came around...
...i waved at the raft, and they came and got me...
there were tents set up all over.
i arrived on friday night.
we, deafies, went to maine for white water rafting.
really, last weekend, i got together with twenty friends
we were ready for our great adventure!
...and another guy, mike daisy, who also fell off.
we had to be patient because we got up at seven o'clock in the morning.
we stayed up very late. the next morning we woke up.
we got back into our seats.  i was a bit shaken..
there was a lot of beer everwhere, and people mingling.
they pulled me back onto the raft.
we got in the bus, took off, and arrived to one river.
we went in the bus after breakfast.
she threw up a little, it was really nothing big, it was as if she had a cold or something.
but she spit up the water.
she was coughing and i thought maybe we would have to do cpr on her.
i pulled her close with the paddle and then pulled her back on.
they will know when it is the right time to stop rowing or drag the paddle.
i held my paddle out to her.
there were eight of us in the raft,  and both people in front had to be hearing.
so i can follow how to row.
we started to sit down.
we had a leader that sat at the back of the raft.
i have to admit that it was my first time.
i didn't know what to do--i thought it would feel like being on a boat on the water.  i thought it wasn't a big deal.  
it was close by, twenty minutes away from our camp ground.
we sat on the raft.
so we sat down and got ready.
the leader would yell but we deaf people cannot hear him in the back.
most of us got in the spa.
we just sat and relaxed--aaahhh...
 ...and called it a day.  we pulled over.
we got back on the bus and arrived at the campground.
really, everything was fine; the girl was worried .
i arrived...
it is ironic because we both fell before,
the only left was me and mike daisy. it's ironic that us two stayed on.  it is strange.
the raft went down some rapids--really, it was fifteen feet straight down
i looked at him and said ok, that is fine.
we went down and many people fell off.
i braced myself as we went down--i was expecting to fall out.
...i don't know, it started with a k.  it's a long word, that river.
i pulled people back onto the raft.
one woman who was riding with us...
...was stuck under the boat and could not breathe for a while.
i reached under the raft and found her.
...but he and i were the ones to "survive" that drop.

the pigs blew on the fire and it grew.
a wolf saw the three pigs; they all screamed and hid, each in his own house.
this is the story of the three pigs.  
wolf arrived.
the pig went into the wood house.  he and his brother asked themselves what they should do.  they sat down together.
it was a beautiful brick house.
the pigs felt the roof vibrating.  they looked up...
the wolf looked at the house.  it looked different--it was made of brick. 
he slowly and laboriously laid the bricks.  he slowly built the house.
the wolf held his sore behind in relief, then ran away.  the three pigs happily celebrated and danced.  they lived together for ever after.  
the wolf inhaled deeply and blew at the house.  the grass house blew away.  
the three pigs said, "no, we'll see about that.  go ahead--try."
the wolf went to the grass house and looked it over.
to build his house, he chopped up trees.
the third pig was a hard worker, and liked to decorate.
wolf inhaled deeply and then blew the house away.
 the pigs looked up.  the wolf looked down the chimney and started to climb down.  his tail hung down under him.  the fire burned beneath him. 
there is a wood house.
the wolf was getting more angry.  "again!" he yelled. "one, two, three..." he took another deep breath and blew at the house. 
the pig refused. he closed and locked the door, sat, and waited. 
the two pigs were left under the open air; they were sitting, looking around, and saw the wolf!
the grass house was blown away.  the pig looked around in shock.
he cut down some grass...
again, there is the grass house.
wolf looked at them and said," i am ready to catch and eat you!"
... on which area each would have and went ahead to start setting them up.
he built himself a house made of wood.
the wolf said, "i'm ready to eat you three.  i'll do it."
"i smell pigs.  where are the pigs that smell so delicious?"  thought the wolf.
she informed the three pigs that it was time for them to go away and be on their own.
wolf said, "i warned you, one... two... three..."
then what happened was a wolf arrived in the area
the house still stood strong.  the pigs started celebrating even more.  
"i could go up to the roof and down the chimney," the wolf thought, and he started climbing.  the three pigs stopped celebrating inside the house. 
but...  he didn't decorate a whole lot, either.  he was just average. 
...bundled the grass, and built his house with that.
a mother took care of her three pigs.
the three pigs said "ok," and then left.
the pig looked up to see the wolf staring at him. 
the wolf wondered what he should do.  he looked around the house and saw the chimney coming out from the roof. 
"i will visit often," she said. 
the next pig, well, he wasn't lazy...
wolf chased after the pigs.  two pigs went into the brick house.
he looked and got scared.  he got up and ran to the wood house.
the wolf started to get angry.  when the three pigs realized that they were safe, they began to celebrate.  
the house was still standing; it was a strong house.  the wolf was surprised. 
the wolf looked at the pig and said, "ok, i warned you. one... two... three..."
so the first pig had a grass house. 
one of the pig's tended to be lazy and just do things 'well enough'.
she said "go ahead and build your homes".
the pig, i mean, the wolf arrived and stared at him.
...and realized that the wolf was trying to come down the chimney.  "ahh! hurry!" they said and hastily built a fire in the fireplace. 
he didn't want a fancy house.
wolf reached down to attack, but two pigs ran away towards the brick house just before wolf could catch them.
the three pigs went out looking for a location.
when the three pigs grew up...
he arrived at the wood house.
the wolf looked toward the pigs and said, "fine.  ready?..." he took a deep breath and blew at the house.  
"i warn you, get out or else i will snatch you and eat you up!" wolf said.
the pigs went in and discussed what to do; they closed and locked the windows and doors.
 the fire began to burn the wolf's tail.  the wolf threw himself out of the chimney; he flew out. 
the wolf was surprised.  he had been confident that he would destroy the house.  he looked back at the house. 
he tended to put a lot of effort into his work.
the pigs said," what should we do?  let's wait and see."
each pig went off in their own direction.
he built a (wood, no) brick house.
they finally found an area. they all seemed to agree...
the wolf landed in a pond; a ball of steam rose from the pond.
then he will go and buy another book.
the teacher expects john to read a lot.
when that's done, when he's read the book, he will give it to the teacher.
john is in the house right now reading a book.
his parents have been giving and buying him books for a while now.
(the teacher) regularly watches him,  encouraging him to read.
what he is crazy about reading about is cars.
he pulls off the lid...
the victim's body still lies there limp.  he is frustrated.
the house shakes again, louder and worse than before.  he ran downstairs.
he pries open each corner.
"i... it must...i don't know"
he replaces the cover.
...and he nails the lid back on.  he is exhausted.
from now on, i won't sleep. that's it. 
"i won't go to sleep."
he walked upstairs.  "it couldn't be..."
"it must be a head trip or something,"
he rushes downstairs and pries the lid off
the coffin shakes violently
he takes off the lid and a hand reaches out of the coffin and chokes him!
he looks at the limp body in the coffin
he puts the cover back on and nails each corner.
"nah, i am fine," he reassures himself. 
when the sun rises, he asks himself, what was that, with the shaking? 
"what was that?" he asked.  "i don't know."
"i think it was only a dream, or just my imagination about things.  i don't know--forget it," he said
"i am fine," he said.
he drank coffee all day.
he continues through the forest as lightning strikes and rain pours.
he spots his victim in the distance; the victim looks back over his shoulder, as the husky man continues to walk in persuit. 
through a forest road lurches a husky person.
the sun sets.  lightning strikes.  rain falls. 
the trees pass by, as lightning strikes and rain pours.  
he keeps drinking cofffee.
a person was holding heart while carrying dead person.
the tapper thrusts his hand into his victim's body and pulls out the heart.  he picks up the body and slings it onto his shoulder. 
"i'll go to sleep," he says.  he gets under the covers...
taps the shoulder.  the tappee turns, then looks forward again.
he keeps drinking it through sundown.
the attacker walks through the forest, up a winding path to a house. 
the attacker takes a big bite of the still-beating heart, then throws it away.
he nailed down each corner of the lid and pushed the coffin back.
"ok..." and he puts the cover back on. 
"that person is somewhere inside the house.  oh, no..."
 "...and i ate his heart!" 
there is a lound banging, and the house shakes.
"i killed him," the person said.
sunset and then sunrise.  the house starts shaking loudly.
he gets out of bed and goes downstairs to see what is happening.
he puts the cover back on and nails down each corner.
he yawned, went upstairs, and went to bed. 
he takes down a pry bar and pries open the coffin at each corner.
he picks up the victim's body and lays it in the coffin.
he turns the doorknob, kicks open the door, and picks his victim back up.
he puts his victim down.  there is a wood coffin.
he removes the lid.
he gets his crow bar and opens the coffin
he walks upstairs and goes to sleep.
the sun sets, and just at dawn again the banging and the shaking begin
"nah, i must have imagined things."
"i'm going back to bed," the man said.
"i better get going," he said.
"nah, i must have imagined things," he says to himself
he pries open the coffin
lightning strikes and rain pours.  a storm is whipping up. 
two days go by, and he stays up, drinking coffee. 
i will keep drinking coffee.
he lies back in bed.  the house starts shaking and banging around. 
he stays awake, but eventually crashes and sleeps. 
the attacker lays down his victim's body.
it is empty.
"where did it go? where did it go?" he asks himself.
"really....uh...."
"really, is that man in here?" he asks himself
he removes the coffin lid and looks in.

thirdly, the hospital often will discuss about the communication options.
it seems that parents must choose one between oralism, cochlear implant, sign language or cued-speech. they can't pick all of the options.
it is very intimidating. there will be seven professionals informing the two parents that their child seem to be sick or have the "cancer".
that's how powerful the language is.
we will be talking about early intervention now. when parents gives a birth to a baby, the baby would go to a hearing screening.
one group would use the word hit; other group uses smashed; and another group uses collided. i think there are four or five different words/groups.
then they would ask the hit group about the car and whether if the glass was broken.
there is another research in australia with the similar idea.
there are two groups with same guidelines. one group has deaf professionals being involved, while another group did not.
the researches have proven that a child with a deaf mentor often perform better. there is a research that studies two groups from utah and tennessee.
the early intervention services for both groups had the same checklist.
why don't we discuss it as the journey through experience?
ask the next group how fast were the cars going before they collided.
it seems like the hospital needed to intervene because the parents were doing lousy job with their child.
the baby is just deaf. it's not their fault, they're doing perfectly fine.
of course the parents would be scared. "i am sorry" is never a good thing.
similarly, the study asks them how fast were the cars going before they crashed into each other.
the study notices how the hit group thinks that the glass wasn't broken at all.
then they regathered the groups a week later and asked them some questions.
therefore, overall, there's a missing link. if we change that, it will influence the deaf children to develop better.
they often use the word "diagnosis" it's very negative and it's used for more negative references, such as sickness or cancer. or maybe terminal illness.
it makes sense because the parents will learn from the deaf mentor after including him/her in the family. the parents will start to realize how important it is to involve in the deaf community.
parents cannot simply rely on a deaf mentor. they must do more such as being involved in the deaf community.
a deaf role model who has been trained can show the parents that he/she is perfectly fine.
he/she can read and write. he/she can communicate. he/she can work. he/she has an education. there's a long list of that and he/she is perfectly fine.
that makes it to seem like an opportunity to do more than one.
they really can do all of the options. one family can choose to use sign language, and if another family wants to use speech, that's fine.
why don't they use a word like "identified" as in "i've identified this child deaf"? now it does not seem bad at all.
now parents often would start considering discussing with the hospital for the early intervention. but the word makes it seems like they are intervening.
the screening shows that the baby is deaf.
or ask the collided group about the car and if the glass was broken?
the parents of the group with deaf professionals would get through the grief progress quicker and usually be able to move on quickly.
both locations had the same number of meetings; same occurences of home visits; same kind of school; and the same resources.
except for utah group, the child had a deaf mentor, while the group from tennessee did not.
it would turn into a positive thing.
often in the meeting; all people in the room are hearing except for the baby.
the car was going around 20 mph when it smashed. the smashed group said they think the car's glass was broken and it was going around 60 mph. but, actually, the glass wasn't broken at all.
why don't we use "early involvement", which means involving the parents by sharing the resources and working together; and not intervening them.
then they would refer the parents to the early intervention professionals.
the meeting will include a specialist, audiologist, doctor, nurse, counselor, and social worker. there are seven specialists for only two parents. wow.
car was going only twenty to thirty mph. it shows how the language influences individuals' answers even though they all were watching the same video clip.
for example, they used different words for each group while asking them the questions.
be friends with their child's friend's parents. it's important to be connected and they must collaborate with others.
the parents will realize and embraces the situation more calmly. without a deaf role model, we are missing the link of connection between the parents and the deaf person.
the doctors often would say "we should discuss the grief progress. here's the social worker and counselor, they will help you to nagivate the grief progress."
the parents might will perceive this as something they should to be upset about.
or they will ask another group smashed about the car and whether if the glass was broken.
so, for the hit group, they asked them how fast were the cars going before they hit?
"intervention" implies the need of intervening such as an intervention for drug addicts, stopping something from happening, or when a kid is not behaving well.
the first thing the doctor and nurse would say to the parents would be "i am sorry." it's an automatic negative. "i am sorry that your child is deaf".
ask another group, the crashed group about the car and whether if the glass is broken.
not just in the hospitals, but in general.
there is one interesting study. what the study did they grouped people together and have them watch a video clip of car accident.
i will talk about the early invention field and how hospitals deal with informing the parents when the child is deaf.
there are so many things that are wrong with the system.
when a deaf child does not have a deaf mentor, the family will continue to be disappointed and their grief will last longer.
so, the family must have a deaf role model supporting them.
the study noticed that the deaf child from utah resulted in better social, emotion and cognitive developments.
we should bring in the deaf mentor to meet the parents.
i will list some. for example, the power of language in hospitals.
while for the deaf babies, they are not any of them.
it's important that the child signs. hospitals don't use 'communication opportunities' as their word choices.

... while i was growing up until i was six  and a half years old.
we were okay with it, so that`s when my family moved there.
i moved into the dorm again. during that time, my parents had been living where they were for more than seven years, but i had already left home before that.
i never lived in a house...
so i didn`t need to worry about attending a hearing school or a deaf school.
my mother taught my two brothers and me, so it was easier for us to move around.
there's something strange about myself.
because his job involved a big project located south, in new york.
that went on for around six years.
so we moved south to new york
so basically, i almost never went home to except for vacations or long weekends, that`s when i would commute. but, most of the time i stayed in rochester...
so, we agreed with the decision and went ahead and moved south to new york; it was around an hour north of nyc.
so, the family in fact move here, and i took the opportunity to move in and live with my family at the new house in rochester.
so, may seem like i stayed there longer than seven years.    but then it hit me...
i was like, “oh, wow, that`s fine.” he wanted to transfer to rochester because he wanted to work at rit too.
... for more than seven years.
when i was nearly all done with rit. after about my third year. my father sensed that he had pretty much had it with ibm; he wanted to retire and change his career.
since then, i have lived there for around almost three years.
... for two years, when i was a junior and then a senior in high school. after i graduated from high school, i went to r.i.t., rochester institute of technology.
so, it wasn't worth it for him to commute frequently for a long distance, it was better for the family to move away.
i lived there in a house with my parents and two brothers...
i decided i wanted to transfer  to the rochester institute.
my parents were alright with it. i transferred to rsd, i stayed in the dorm.
my family decided to move to vermont because my father got a job transfer with ibm.
i guess i should`ve been moving away again, but my parents were okay with the same job.
i graduated recently, so that`s means i`ll be looking for a job, probably i`ll move away, so i won't have lived there for seven years.   now, i`m wondering from now on with the new job does that mean i might be moving around again for the next seven years or less?   so i`m wondering, let`s see, oh well.
i wanted to be involved in sports and after-school activities, plus many other things. i wanted to be more socialized. so,
still when i was twelve and a half years old, after six and a half years in all, my father found out that he would have to move away again
but, you might wonder how i managed, with moving frequently, well i was home schooled.
i grew up there between the age of six and a half and thirteen.
