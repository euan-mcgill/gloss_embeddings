... and the cop found the situation funny -- we were lucky .   we were relieved .
a cop pointed his finger to us and said , " do n't ever do that again because i drove here all the way from la for that . "
erick said yes , we will have to wait for the cop to arrive .
" alright , fine , " we said .   we waited for a while .   the cop arrived ...
back then , there was a fine system at csun in case you caused trouble .
i was relief and it was good that we got regular and open - minded cop .
erick was supposed to fine us .
i went and explained the situation .   the hall coordinator was not friendly .
i had go to see his superior , the hall coordinator .
actually , we had to do one thing as punishment .
he decided to waive the fine because he thought it was funny .
i took the rope off the handle and peeked in the door .
" hi , i   was just teasing you , " i said .
erick said , " i was worried , you know , what if i had an emergency ? "
i would n't be able to get out , would n't be able to get to another building ...
he asked , " why did you do that ? " i did n't have an answer , and i felt bad .
he said , " you know , i called a cop .   he 's coming now . "
i looked at him and asked , " really ? you called a cop on us ? "
i did n't know it was you guys , i thought it was someone else messing with me .
really , we were trouble makers .
four of us boys lived in a dorm room .
my first year at csun .
seven years ago .
really , i had a good time because my ra was my fraternity brother .
i could n't get out of here if i had an emergency at another building , so i had no choice .
really , i know , i am sure those who have lived in a dorm , you hate the ras .   but anyway ...
we would cause problems for our ra , residence counselor , you know , the one who checks up on the dorms .
i looked at him and asked if we really had to wait for the cop to arrive .
i tended to sneak in and cause problems for another residents .
i called the cop to come and cut the rope .
one night , three of us went upstairs -- we lived on second floor ,
it happened one night , that we did n't care and decided to tease him .
we , roommates seven years ago , laughed and had a good time .
i rang the doorbell , and the ra started struggling to get the door open .   i rang the doorbell across the hall , and they pulled back and forth !
neither one could get out !   i was laughing hard
i had the rope tied across the hall .   i rang the ra 's doorbell .
my ra was named erick .
it was perfect -- there was a good distance between the doors .
i tied the rope to the ra 's door handle and to the handle of the door across the hall .
we had rope with us when we went up .
so you know , there were two doors -- his , and another door right across the hall from his door .
... to go up to the third floor .   i rang the ra 's doorbell
we decided to leave them ; we went back down to our room for fifteen minutes , then we felt bad and decided ...
they have huge grass area littered with cigarette butts that people threw on the grass .
i had to go out and clean up the grass .
we sat down and i explained to the hall coordinator .   i was hoping she would find some humor in the situation .
so , she punished us .
we sat down , and she said that she was giving us disciplinary action .
i hoped but really , the hall coordinator is big " b " word -- i do n't want to say it here .
our ra lived on third floor .
we gave the bag to the hall coordinator .
i gave her the bag and asked , " are you happy now ? "   she said , " do n't do it again "
from then on , we were good and stayed out of trouble at csun .
it was probably from us anyway so we went .   we picked them up and threw them in a bag .
the cop walked over and started talking .
there is an old story passed down through generations of deaf people
the hearing person said , " go ahead sleep " as he drove .
the deaf person said , " sure thing " and drove away .
the cop thought to himself , " whatever " , and told the men , " go ahead " .
" he got excused two times ! " , the hearing person thought .
the deaf person gestured he could n't hear .
the cop put on his siren . when he did , the hearing man looked and pointed back .
a cop walked over to the car and started talking .
the siren flashed and the two cars pulled over .
the hearing man looked at him shocked .
the hearing person looked and thought , " wow , he is lucky ! " .
the hearing person thought , " i can copy and act like the deaf person " .
it was long drive and the deaf person was tired .
they communicated fine through gesture and chatted a bit as they drove .
the hearing person thought " wow , he got excused ! " .
the cop walked over to the car and started talking .
the hearing man wondered whether   deaf people can drive .
the deaf man said , with confidence , " it 's ok " and then the two cars pulled over .
another cop pulled them over .
as he drove , he saw a person hitchhiking .
sure enough , a cop began following the car .
the deaf person continued driving and started to speed again .
sure enough , a police car pulled up behind them .
as the deaf man drove , he started to speed up .
a deaf man was driving alone .
the man pulled over .
the deaf person tapped the hearing person 's shoulder and asked if he would mind switching .
he thought to himself " why do n't i have him join me to chat and keep me company or something . "
the car started to speed up to 90 .   the hearing person looked at the meter and thought " wow ! " .
the cop said , " oh i see ! my parents are deaf " .
hearing person said , " ok , that s fine . " they switched seats .
he drove for a long time .
the hearing man started to get nervous and kept looking at the speedometer .
the hearing man got into the car , the deaf man began driving .
he was hearing , the person who 's hitchhiking .   the deaf person looked over ...
the hearing person decided to go ahead and speed up .
the deaf man asked the hearing man " where are you going ? " the hearing man tried to use gesture to explain .
the hearing person gestured that he could n't hear .
the hearing person was excited . he ran over to the car and started talking .
as he drove across the country ,   he started to feel bored while driving .
the deaf person said , " you seem fine , i am going to sleep . "
the cop thought , " nah " and said , " go ahead . "
" i am a fluent signer , " the cop said , and started signing .
the deaf man turned to the cop and gestured that he could n't hear .
the hearing man was shocked the cop could sign and he knew that he had been caught !
the hearing person did n't care and got into the car .
the cop said , " oh you ca n't hear ? " . then he thought , " how can i communicate with him ? " .
the deaf man indicated he could n't hear .
i saw the deer but it was too late .
i remember a while ago , i was driving ...
i went ahead and got back on 80 .
the deer looked at me and then moved on to cross the road .
... a big pile of grass that looked delicious !
i pulled the car onto route 80 .
the deer saw , across the road ...
the car swerved off the road .
the headlights got closer and closer to the deer .
it happened that , far down the road ...
... there was a deer .
i caught my breath .   it had been a close call .
seeing that , the deer decided to walk across the road .
i swerved and slammed on the brakes ; the headlights shone right in the deer 's face .
my car was in the middle of the road , angled perpendicular to the road .   i did n't know which direction i had been going !
the deer was in shock and scared .
i was driving through beautiful hills .
i drove up the hill with my headlights on .
i was n't sure which way to go .
i thought " why do n't i just drive on " .
... over a hill ...
the flat road was boring but at least it was safe !
as i drove , the deer turned and looked at me .
i was driving for a long time .
my heart was beating really fast .
i noticed some animal crossing the road .
i was enjoying the drive .
occasionally , i would pass a house or two .
i was driving across the u.s .
as i was driving i thought " why do n't i turn off the road . "
i was trying to gain control of the car as it swerved .
as i was driving , i was really bored . so i started thinking about what i could do .
with the headlights on , i kept driving .
i drove really slowly .
the car spun .
i swerved hard , right before i was about to hit the deer .
it started to get dark , so i turned on the headlights .
i turned off the road at the exit .
the road was very dry and plain .
my heart was pounding .
i drove the car along the road .
i decided to head down one of the ways .
i was driving through the country .
( i was ) on interstate 80 , the one that goes straight across the country .
as i held the wheel , i thought to myself " wow " . then i looked back at the road .
the deer was frozen in shock .
i saw a sign up ahead .
the deer was eating grass .
it was for route 80 .   i saw it .
i looked and saw an exit ahead .
the deer stopped eating grass and looked up .
i drove along the curvy two - lane highway .
in la , the service is awful ; some people ca n't speak english .
here ( in boston ) , they have good service , well not 100 percent of time but you tend to get good service --- they make sure you 're comfortable .
its same kind of situation in food markets , restaurants , banks , and many different places .
people go too far :   they use umbrellas , wear rain coats , and put boots and pants on .
even if it is just barely raining -- like a few drops .   i remember one day ...
while in la , its better and perfect because of no rain .
well , it rains once a while .   the funny thing about when it rains in la ...
i noticed many people were looking at me like i was a complete idiot .   really , i did n't know what the big deal was .
i would go to class on my rollerblades , in shorts and a tank top , you know , like a basketball jersey .
there was a bit of rain as i rollerbladed .
... la would flood for sure .
there would be flooding .   if a whole year 's worth of boston 's rain were given to la , ...
oh well .   wow -- one negative thing about la is that in la , they did n't have any sewer systems .
i thought the weather was nice , a little rainy but it was nothing .   people were wearing long sleeves !
i think its probably because la is big so they did nt really care about community as much as bostonians do .
i would write something down but they still would n't understand me .   that 's how bad the service is in la !
people were not very outgoing , friendly , welcoming in the community .
i decided to check the price .   i see the price tag : 350 dollars .   really , 350 dollars for a shirt ? !
in one store , i was looking at this really nice silk shirt .
still , wow , it is very expensive in la .
i would say the most expensive shirt here in boston is up to maybe 100 , 150 dollars .   i would n't know -- i do n't buy expensive shirts , but hey .
but here in boston , the weather is really unpredictable .   it could be rainy , hot , cold or cool .
there are many various things ( in boston weather ) , but one thing i notice about la ...
... and here in boston is that the fall , in september , seems about the same .
i would notice once when the leaves change color , and some start to fall off and grass is really green .
it is perfect , but during the fall in la , it still looks like summer .   it is still very hot .
the grass is a little bit brownish because of too much sun , and there is not enough rain to feed the flowers and plants .
in december in boston , of course it snows , gets colder and the leaves fall off the trees , leaving them " naked . "
in la , it gets a little bit cooler ,   but at same time it is still hot .
there are many things to compare .   for example , boston 's food is delicious and better ( than la ) .
i went to la after finishing high school .   i went to college at csun , calfornia state university at northridge . i went in ' 96 .
i was born and raised in boston .
i am going to compare two different cities , boston and los angeles .
the farm system in california is more outside because it is too hot to have it inside .
to most bostonians who are in la it still feels hot , 70 to 75 degrees .
third , the fruits and vegetables in california taste fresher , since they grow in california .
... is not great .   however , maybe they have better dairy products . i do n't know .
i have to admit that during spring time in boston , it rains a lot .
first of all , i think nothing compares with boston seafood . second , the meat here is fresh and more flavorful .   california meat ...
the sun still shines warmly , but during night time , it gets a little cooler .
same idea for food shopping : in la , a loaf of bread costs 3 or 4 bucks while here in boston it 's only $ 1.50 to two dollars and it is even a bigger loaf than in la .
really , i 'm not just talking about just economic differences , but rather cultural differences as well .
so , let 's see , what else is on the list ... i have to admit that mexican food in la is better .
bostonians seem more friendly in general .
outside it 's still hot and dry , but it 's still easier to grow crops in the l.a . area .
for example : here , when i 'm driving , and two cars come up to the same intersection ,
i would wave the other person on , he would say " thanks ! " and wave back .
but in la , would they do that ? no -- they do n't care and just drive right through .
a few times while i was in la , i waved people on .   i thought they would say thanks back , but the other drivers just ignored me and zipped across .   i said , " oh , you 're welcome , too . oh well , " and drove on .
still , i hope that boston could give la a good example of cohesiveness
you have to make a name for yourself before you join the " elite " clubs .
but in the la area or north , well really mostly in la area , there are many smaller cliques .
people make sure to keep in touch . even if you dislike someone , we say " ah , forget it " and welcome him because we would feel bad otherwise .
of course , boston has four different seasons .
wow , there is a really big difference socially -- in boston deaf culture , everyone mixes together as if we were from the same family .
well , that is what i learned in l.a .
other than food , i can compare the two environments .
... or anywhere else . the state is very strict about chemicals . they want to make sure everything runs smoothly .
i have never heard of that kind of situation here in boston .
the same policy goes for sheep . on interstate 5 at one of the stops ....
they will stop and make sure no one brings in any fruits or vegetables from mexico .
there is n't any mexican food in the boston area .   it 's not bad , but i do n't really care for mexican food anyway . if you like mexican food though you should take advantage of it in l.a . where it 's delicious .
there are very strict policies on fruit , and vegetables in california .
in la , the weather tends to be " flat"--75 or 80 degrees , sunny and dry , every day .
while in la , they only have one or two seasons .
i do n't buy it .   oh , and la is very fancy and high - class .
like for an example , when i went to beverly hills ...
but in the la area , they did n't see that way .
they say , " if you are my kind , come with me ; if you 're not -- get outta here . "   they pick and choose .
no matter who we are , it is important to have diversity in the group .
it 's the same thing with siberian tigers -- their stripes vary .   it 's the same idea here in boston .
in northridge , it tends to be ten to fifteen degrees hotter than la .
the sun is more intense here , while in la it 's dry , but it 's 100 to 110 degrees .
here ( in boston ) it could rain every day and people would still live through it without a problem .
why ? because they have a better sewer system in boston to drain water .
another thing : in the summer , it 's very humid here .
but of course , it does n't rain everyday in boston .   we have wonderful weather here .
of course , it 's because l.a . is near the mexican border .
really , it 's a big difference from here .
if it 's 80 degrees here in boston , it can feel really hot .   but in la , 80 degrees feels like nothing .
in la , the sun is farther away .   here , the sun feels closer , more intense , because the seasons change .   that 's all for that ...
... other than weather , we can also talk about boston culture and la culture .
if you see on weather channel , you will notice that if its 85 degrees in la , that means 100 degrees in northridge .
the teacher is at the movies .
after the movie ends , the teacher will buy a book to give to the student to read .
" i do n't want you to run to the fans and cheer .
" i want you to come back and sit down where you belong .
" i do n't want to see you dance ,
" i do n't want to see you scream
reading the book , that kind of ...
" ... and wait until it 's your turn to play again . "
what motivating words vince lombardi used !
personally , i think i 'm a better coach than a player ...
so i decided to play high school football .
i just thought it was eleven guys hitting another eleven guys .
i never realized that football could have that much emotion involved .
they did n't care about money : back in the 50s and 60s , football ...
... really , football players now make millions of dollars .
before , they used to play for food , or for , i do n't even know ...
it was the same as any regular life -- later they would work at the post office , or , i do n't know ...
... so that , vince lombardi -- i remember his special speech ...
... before facing the oakland raiders in the first super bowl .
he came in and told his men :
" i do n't want to see any end zone ...
it 's eleven on eleven ; players on the two teams match up in the competition .
it is really inspiring .   it involves many things :
... is my favorite sport .
really , football ...
there are many different options : they can pass to the wide receiver ,
" ... celebrations when you score a touchdown .
... the quarterback , who has the running back behind him .
the offense picks a bunch of guys who weigh 300 , 350 pounds to block ...
" i want to see you put the ball down on the ground ...
one team has the offensive line ...
" i want to see , once you 're in that end zone ,
they can throw to the tight end , maybe , or , i do n't know ...
or they can hand off to the running back ,
vince lombardi , before his men walked onto the field ,
... or , i do n't know , really many other things .   it 's the same idea as in chess : it 's a thinking game
it could be , i do n't know , a quarterback sack ,
... it can create a fumble ,
i really was engrossed by football .   he , ...
it can create an opportunity for the other team to win ,
... i did n't know much about football untill my mom gave me that book .
i remember i was young .   it was my first book i read ...
my mother bought me a book written by vince lombardi .
really , up until then , as i was growing up , i ...
... i mean , unless you use your helmet to hit someone , but ...
really , i 've been thinking it reminds me of who really made me get interested in football .
really , i find that to be a very amazing challenge .
especially when football is the only legal sport where you can hit someone that hard and not get fined for it .
he made sure his players would " give it all . "
... vince lombardi , was really a winner .
... he told his men , " hey , remember : winning is n't everything--
it 's the only thing .
he said , " men , we must march into that end zone ...
... this is really my favorite quote .   before that super bowl game ,
i enjoy the hits -- i enjoy the pain sometimes , i admit , but , uh ...
... but at the same time i love to play .
really , vince lombardi told his men ...
... not all the time .   like my hand , haha -- no , not like that .
... they can get creative , mix it up .   really , after a thousand plays , you can be creative during the game .
" then hit , and hit , and hit ! "
i know , it seems like three simple words , " hit and hit and hit , "
but when a hit is made in football ,
... it can create many things .
" ... and then come back and wait until it 's your turn , " just like i said before

the reporter asked ali 's wife if he was alright .
he died way back , when i was around 8 years old .
he tends to shake sometimes and he had a hard time trying to focus on things .
i wish he and i could have watched it together .
he started to really shake and the reporter got scared .   he was n't sure how to approach that kind of situation .
he scared the reporter , his wife was great ... wow .
the reporter asked muhammad ali a simple question .
so , after that , i wish i could tell my grandfather that story .
ali started to ...   well , you know he has parkinson 's disease ...
while they had dinner , the sports reporter collected more information about muhammad ail .
his wife cooked and got things ready for dinner .   then , they all sat down and talked .
after i watched that story , muhammad ali became my favorite boxer .
his wife invited a reporter over their house .
sometimes he   imagines he is still boxing in the ring ,
his wife said " well , sort of ... sometimes he has bad dreams . "
... still taking punches .   sometimes he will stand up and start swinging his fists .
the reporter said , " really , muhammad ali would stand up and start punching at people ? "
the wife said " yes , i have seen him beating up one man for no reason "
the reporter said , " really ? " as he looked at muhammad ali .
ali was sitting , shaking ; then he got up slowly and started punching the air .
ali walked toward the reporter , grabbed him by the collar , pulled him close , and shook his fist in the reporter 's face .
the reporter was really scared .   muhammad ali put him back in his seat , and said , " i am just teasing , do n't worry ! "
he laughed and sat down .   i had goose bumps on my arms .
i do n't remember it well because i was too young but ....
he asked me to sit down and watch boxing .   i did n't really get it .
it was a show about his life story . i was completely fascinated by it .
my grandfather was a big boxing fan .
in the past , when i was four or five years old ...
i was not laughing , yes i know it was funny , but i got goose bumps on my arms .
i would work out and have great abdominal muscles on my stomach .   wow -- it would require a lot of time , though ,
as i watched , i thought to myself , " i would n't mind doing boxing in the future " .
but he still , uh , he still is able to find humor in many things .
i said " oh , i see , " then i began watching the boxing on tv .
... because muhammad ali has parkinson 's disease ...
my father told me that i used to love boxing when i was growing up .
last year , i watched a story about muhammad ali on cnn .
... so i dropped it .   one thing that hit me when i was watching tv ...
i opened the menu ; the choices were limited , but we let it slide .
the food was not good , so we just left it .
the tables and chairs were all wood .   it looked like a log cabin .
i told the waitress that i was unsatified with the food and that we 'd pay for the drinks .
we were uneasy ,   but we said " ok , fine , " and the three of us sat down around a table .
really , i would have preferred a mcdonald 's burger -- they're better than this one was .   oh well .
i went in ; the place was really creepy .
i took a bite ... it was gross .   we all decided , " forget it . "
there were no waiters ...
i kept driving .   i hurried because i knew there would be a mcdonald 's on the road .   we found a mcdonald 's right near the end of nebraska .
my friend said " nah , its better to pull over . " " okay , fine , " i said , " i 'd be happy to . " i said sarcastically .   we pulled over .
we went into a restaurant .   i was hungry because i had n't eaten lunch yet .
the waitress said , " are you sure ? do you want anything else ? "   i said , " nah , i 've decided to take off . "
" be patient , we 'll drive together , and the rain will dissipate . " i said .
we left .   as we were driving , we were really hungry .
it is important to escape the big storm .
the waitress came over .   i told her that i 'm deaf .
we decided to have hamburger and french fries , something simple .
i kept on driving . i was going 85 , 88 , 90 mph all the way through there .
we wnt straight on through indiana , then illinois , no -- first illinois , then indiana .   it was a good drive ; i kept going overnight .
then i drove straight through iowa ... i think it was iowa ... yes , it was iowa .
i thought,"perfect ! " we pulled off and took the opportunity to eat at mcdonalds .
we were lucky and took advantage of it .   after we drove a good while we decided to stop in illinois .
there were no cops .   the speed limit there is 75 mph , so ...
we stayed overnight .    let 's stop , and put this aside .
the waitress came up and talked into my ear .
i gestured , " no , i 'm deaf ! "   so she came around and started talking right in my face .   i said , " no , no -- move back . "
i wrote to explain that deaf people can read lips .
really , some can read lips and some communicate with paper and pen .
the waitress said , " oh .   which do you prefer ? "   i said i wanted paper and pen , haha .
because that waitress was really hard to understand .
... anyway , i wrote that i wanted a burger with fries , just simple ... cooked medium ..
my friends did the same .   they both wrote down their orders , we gave the waitress the paper , and off she went .
i could n't chat as i was driving .
i was disappointed -- you know this , my pager ?   it did n't work all the way through nebraska .
i told them its important to go slowly , 45 or 50 mph .
really , all the way through nebraska ...
after i explained wyoming , the tons of cows and all that ...
we waited and waited .   the rain stopped ; i said , " oh , good . "
i did n't realize that nebraska was really that big ! but anyway , so i was driving ...
" really , it 's about 500 miles across nebraska . "
the food finally came .   i looked again -- it had plain wonder bread for a bun and a tiny little burger .
... it 's really far to omaha -- it 's the end of nebraska
i was in a hurry for the food to arrive -- i wanted to take advantage of the good weather for driving , but it did n't work out that way .   we waited and waited and waited .
" really , i was driving alone .   my two friends were driving in front of me .   so i drove ... "
my friends in front of me wanted to pull over .
all of sudden , a strong storm hit .   i was a bit nervous driving through it .

she said , " so you know , mike 's really hearing .   he 's not deaf . "
my parents asked " how do you know ? "
dana saw this and saw that i was obviously hearing .
she was disappointed and walked over to tell my parents .
she told them that i had woken up and cried
dana said , " i went down and got some pots and pans ...
... and i banged them together as he was sleeping . "
she decided to do something else .
dana was still upset that i was n't d- , well , that i was n't deaf .
the next day , i woke up .
my parents said , " really ? oh well . "
then they would find out if i 'm deaf .
dana was impatient .   she said , " can we ask the doctor ? "
my mother said , " enough ! cut it out . "
that first night they brought me home ...
... i arrived home ....
... i was sleeping in the crib .
dana was watching me .   she was mischevious , dana was -- same as me growing up .
but anyway , dana decided to gather some pots and pans .
i have an older sister .
my parents gave birth to dana .
... i had become , or had found out that i had become deaf .
really , maybe you want to know why ...
said that she want to have a deaf sister .
while my parents were sleeping , she snuck downstairs ...
dana wanted a deaf sister .
my mother got pregnant with me .
she started banging the pots !   i woke up and started crying .
when she was three and half or four years old ,
she pulled a bunch of pots from the cabinet and went back upstairs to my room .
" i hope , i hope , i hope , " she said .
she would tell my mother everyday " i want a deaf sister . "
i was definitely deaf .
so my mother told dana ...
i did not even hear it .
she screamed my name into my ear .
my mother said , " we ca n't tell if he is deaf , but if he is ... that 's the way it goes ... "
she talked into my ears and i did n't pay attention .
when dana found out that i was boy , she found accepted it .
but it was important that i was deaf .
my mother said " we will see . "
the time came -- i was ( finally ) born .
maybe it is a boy too .
my sister said " no , i do n't have that feeling ; i will get a deaf sister . "
maybe the baby will be hearing , but we 'll still love it the same .
" but i 'm hoping that it 's deaf , too . "
wait until he gets bigger and feels comfortable at home .
after ( the baby ) is born , you have to ...
i am sure she is still telling many strangers about me .
... about how she found out that i had become deaf .
even today , dana still tells everyone .
right now she 's in europe ...
" you have a deaf brother . "
dana was jumping around , she was so excited .
dana walked around behind me screamed .
but anyway i was sitting ...
i was in my high chair .
really , i was sitting ...
i have a picture , it 's cute .
you know , where ( babies ) sit when they 're eating ... it has a tray .   i had a bib on ...
my mother told her to take it easy , said " we 'll see ... "
and my mother saw the whole thing .
my   mother just stared .
she walked over to dana and said , " maybe he is deaf . "
she was looking at me .
i did n't even look back .

they hit me twice with the nightstick and punched me in the eye .
i was in shock .
... i was planning to tell them i 'm deaf .   as i raised my arm to sign " deaf , " ...
they grabbed my arm and bent it behind my back .
because i was so shocked that i , i do n't know .
why did they hit me ? i did nt feel anything !
i felt numb .
they ignored me .
i tried to tell the cop that i 'm deaf .   i spoke , " deaf , deaf ! "
then they grabbed my hands and handcuffed me .   i was under arrest .
what did the cop hit me for ?
they were lapd , and were coming up running .
i thought " what 's going on ? "
really , i was nt sure .
why are they chasing me ? i asked myself .
i thought it was because they saw me going to the bathroom in public or something .
i thought it should be fine , i told myself to think positive about this situation .
so i ...
maybe i could just let them know and say that i was sorry for going to the bathroom in the public .
she had a party .
one girl who lived right next to me .
four years ago at california state university northridge ...
( this is a story of ) one of my worst experiences .
it would n't be a big deal .   oh , it 's important to inform people i 'm deaf , too .
... at the nearby market .
i decided to go buy cigarettes .
two cops walked toward me .   when they were really close to me ...
it was good time .   all night i enjoyed myself .
it is a very important thing to do .
... for us college students to get together .
i walked   to the market .
i 'd say it was only five minutes away walking -- practically nothing .
i pulled a cigarette from my pants pocket and lit up .
then i walked back out from behind the bush .
i was relieved , because it was important that nobody see me .
i looked around to make sure nobody saw me .
i looked around and everything was fine , so i went ahead and used the " bathroom . "
... i saw a bush .
i looked at it and thought , " so what ! ? " i went around the bush .
i admit , i had to go to the bathroom real bad .
i could n't hold my bladder , so i ...
i was looking back and saw two cops running .
i looked back .
take rodney king , for example .
because i felt it would be their word against mine .
you probably wondering why i did n't report it to the police .
that 's something that i hope the lapd will learn
but the hands behind the back , never again !
so he can communicate , either writing or by signing .
or , if they really need to arrest someone , cuff him with his hands in front of his body ...
if something happens and they show up , they should make sure they have paper and pen ready .
i felt fine and just forgot about it .
... to make sure they will approach deaf people in right way .
but , from now on , lapd should really teach their officers ...
but anyway , my friend said " calm down , it 's alright . "
... did he hit me ?   i had a bad headache next morning
i had a big bruise near my eye .   why ...
i was really upset .
he said , " make sure not to pee in public again ! " then he left .
i was ticked , but i decided to ingore him .
" you never know if he 'll have to go to the hospital tonight . "
the cop told my friend , " make sure you keep an eye on him overnight . "
so , fine .   the cop said ...
i bought the cigarettes , put them in my pocket , and walked back .
... like one side of me felt like hitting the cop .
but , of course i could n't do that .
" you will be wasting your time ! "   they were talking back and forth .
i would look bad , and plus ...
my friend looked at him and said " oh , no , no ... "
i was drinking underage , too .
he said , " to pump out his stomach . "
really , i admit , i did n't want to bring up ...
... that i went to the bathroom in public -- i did n't want that on the record .
they have it on tape , beating him up .
but , they still took lapd 's word against rodney king 's .
he took off the handcuffs .
he pushed me and i fell to the ground .
he said , " no , no . "   the cop was just looked at him and shook his head ' no ' .
he was looking and then finally , he was willing ...
i was confused , really i felt many different things at once .
really , i felt ...
i fell -- what was that ? ! then i got up .
of course , i was very upset .
" ... i saw him put something in his mouth "
the cop said , " no ...
how could they guess that ?
i could n't believe it !   i said to myself , " oh my god ! "
then it struck me : i had pulled the cigarette from my pocket and put it to my mouth .
they thought i was popping a pill , i do n't know .
but i tried to tell my friend that i was just smoking a cigarette .
my friend said " oh , " and informed the cop that i was smoking a cigarette .
maybe you misunderstood and thought he was taking something .
the cop said , " no , i saw it very clearly . "
" i will take him to the hospital now . "
the cop looked at my friend and pulled me out of the car .
he said , " hey , hey , i know him !   i know mike , the one in the car . "
he saw me in the cop car .
my friend came downstairs and went outside .
some of my friends said , " really ? "
my friend looked over incredulously .
he knew that i never take drugs .
then my friend asked what was going on .
the cop looked at my friend and said , " he took drugs . "
i was really lucky my friend came in time .
the cop pulled me out of the car ...
i thought -- i did n't know , it could have been .
really , i ended up getting arrested for that ?
i had no clue of what was going on .
they grabbed me and led me off .   i did n't know what to do .
i really thought it was maybe because i went to the bathroom in the public .
why would the   cop arrest me ?
while they brought me to the cruiser , one girl who was ready to go home ...
... saw the whole thing .
she went back up to the party and informed some of my friends ...
... that i had been arrested by the police .
i expected they would put me in the cruiser .
... you know , they have different buildings for different wards .   i went in and waited some more .
my hand kept bleeding and i was still waiting .
i sat down and waited for a long time .   finally , i went in .
i was in the fast express care of the emergency area of the hospital .
he looked at my finger and said he would like to call for a second opinion .
a doctor came in , he was new and had just joined the staff .
i was a bit nervous -- i trust young doctors , but would prefer an older one ;   it does n't matter though , it was fine .
i hoped my finger would n't become dry ( the blood ) or whatever . so i kept waiting .
i still had n't gotten my stitches .
i arrived there at two o'clock and it was already like 4:30 or 5 o'clock ...
i thought " ugh " and ended up waiting again .
i picked up the shampoo bottle and dumped it on my hand .   right after i poured it , it hit me that i could n't use that hand .
while the water was running , i tried to wash myself as best i could -- i could n't use my injured hand .
i went and got another bag to put on my hand .
i was n't thinking .    now shampoo was oozing all over my hand .   geez .
i told my boss that i had to go to the hospital because i needed stitches .
i thought to myself " fine " and went off to the hospital .
a thought struck me ; i pulled out my wallet and opened it ...
... i realized i did n't have my insurance information with me .
so we pulled over to a pay phone and tony called the boss
the boss said his company would cover the costs for stitches on my finger and everything .
my boss said , " yes , go ahead and use my name . " i was relieved .
if he did n't pay for it then i do n't know what i would have done !
we were working , doing landscaping .
tony and i grew up best friends .
yesterday , i worked with my friend .
i am sure you noticed this bandage on my hand and wonder what happened .
my boss is pretty strict .
they maybe would have to send the bill to my parents . my parents would n't be very happy .
there was many different sizes .
the metal corner was really sharp ! it had a big log on it .
we sat down with them to give information about the insurance , my birth date , my social security number , etc .
we were cutting wood using a cutting tool that had a metal edge .
i went to the hospital , but you know how hospitals are , they tend to keep you waiting forever !
then i got back into the shower and washed up . it felt so good !
then , i went to bed for the night to get ready to work all day today .
i worked at a quick pace .
he told us we must finish everything before sunset .
he gave me instructions ; he told me , " you can not get it wet . "
after he finished , he wrapped up my finger .
... that 's kind of how the stitching felt .
i could feel the stitches being pulled through -- it felt like when you tie your shoes ...
i thought maybe i could just bandage it and put pressure on it so it would n't bleed anymore .
my hand became numb , and he stitched it .
i showed him my hand -- it was bleeding profusely .
tony said that i should go to the hospital and i asked , " are you sure ? "
it was not first time someone cut his finger with that same machine .
anyway , i tapped tony and told him the bad news .
when the metal corner sliced my hand , really , wow !
it looked like my fingers had been cut off !
i tried to catch it .
i got the log but the metal corner hit my hand .
so i decided go to the hospital .
i was holding my hand but it still bled through my shirt .   can you imagine that ?
so anyway , i went in the shower -- i had put two bags on my hand to be safe .
i wrapped my hand and the bag with a rubber band and walked into the shower .
i finally arrived home around 7:30 .   i was beat .
really , i had to take shower because i had been working all day , plus i had blood all over me .
then , when you shower , you will need to use a plastic bag to cover your hand .
after he explained everything that i needed to do , i said " fine , alright then " .
my x - ray result showed that my finger was cut to the joint .
he wanted to check if i had some air in my finger which could cause an infection .
i felt funny because a plastic surgeon was going to give me the stitches .
finally , an older man came in ; he was a plastic surgeon .
but all the same , he told me i better go downstairs and get an x - ray .
i thought some regular doctor , nurse , or even doctor 's assistant could do it .
there was one big log that i picked up but then i started to drop it .
i went back upstairs to give the plastic surgeon my x - ray results .
finally , he said we were ready .   he set everything up .
he got the scissors , the needle , and the string .   i saw the needle and the thick string and thought " whoa ! "
he gave my hand a few injections .
he said i was very lucky that my finger was not cut more or i would have lost it .   i was relieved !
the donut tire only lasts for 50 miles so i really had to pull over soon .   we finally arrived at the hotel . we gambled all night and we did n't sleep at all !
and , make sure you have everything ready -- make sure your car is ready before you leave , like i did n't do .
in the morning . however , as i was driving , i found one hotel , but it had a casino too .
my friends were driving in front of me and i waved to get their attention .   i told them that we really had to stay at the hotel because it 's our only choice .
after my trip , it was six days total .
i changed the tire . the tire was a donut tire that is only supposed to last for 50 miles .
i really enjoyed the trip and it was a wonderful time .   it was a lot of fun and i would recommend it to anyone who wants to drive across the country . if so , you can ask me for advice .
and , it 's like 11 o'clock at night -- everything was closed .   i just had to find a place to stay and have the car fixed the next morning .
i started to realize that i had a spare tire in the trunk so it was a good thing that i brought it with me .
i rummaged in the trunk .   i admit that it was my first time changing a tire . i know all men should know how , but unfortunately , i did n't .
my friends were driving in front of me and i was following them .   i had to get their attention by waving my hand so i could pull their car over .
as i got out of my car , i looked at the back of my car and saw one of the tires was flat . the tire literally blew out in two pieces ! it was all gone !
it wo n't open til 9 or 10 in the morning .   we were okay with it even though we had to wait for a bit . the mechanic finally opened and they fixed the tire .
i had to put up and stay up til six or seven in the morning .   i was hoping that gas station would be open by then , since i needed my tire fixed before i went on to boston .
plus an oil change at the same time , which i said was fine . the oil change went fine , but the mechanic said he had some bad news for me . the engine belt had cracked and i needed a new one .
we stayed at the shop for another three hours while they were replacing the belt in the engine along with a oil change and the tire as well . i waited for a long while and finally left nevada at around12 .
when we entered utah , we all were exhausted as we did n't sleep at all .   we were awake all night at the casino at nevada last night .
we decided to continue driving and we got to colorado . we stayed at a place there because it was late . we woke up late because we wanted to catch up on our sleep .
i woke up and realized that driving to boston from la in four days was impossible .   really , i applaud anyone who drives from la to boston .
to drive across the country in four days , you would have to drive about fifteen hours each day to have the right pace to arrive in boston on time .
i drove through wymoing and nebraska . both states were very boring . it was just flat , with cows , etc .
in wyoming -- this just popped into my head -- there was a place with ten thousands cows fenced in . it was sort of a small jail .
we went on a trip to san francisco .   we enjoyed it so much and sf is a beautiful city .
i drove from la to sf to visit a good friend of mine there .
when we were getting ready to get out of nevada , i felt something on the back of my car . all of a sudden , the car dropped down in the back and was skidding .
my two friends joined and we decided to drive to boston .
after i finished the past semester at csun ......
i looked at cows while i was driving and i felt sad for them because they could n't even move . at end of the " jail " , i saw a butcher shop where they were slaughtering the cows . i also saw some dead cows that were hanging !
as my frends and i were driving through the state of nevada , the three of us were really tempted to gamble . so , we decided to stop by at a casino on the border between nevada and california .
i was on i-80 all the way across the country and then i eventually got on i-90 .   i expected that it would take me maybe three or four days to drive across the country . unfortunately , i was wrong !
i drove , and it was flat and plain through iowa , ohio , and illinois i got to new york , and finally i arrived boston .
i drove straight across the country from sf .
that 's so typical of wymoning . we probably get our meat from there . very good meat , too , because i ate a steak there .
i have to admit that sf copies boston a little , but anyway ...
we hoped to get out of nevada soon so we would n't feel tempted to gamble again because we all had lost some money from gambling .
i pulled the car over .   we gambled . i had a good time for maybe a couple of hours and then i got back into the car .

there was waving while we were rowing , and people fell off the raft .
it was fun all day and we had a good time .   we decided to take a break .
i realized it was serious business .
i dug my foot into the side of the raft so i would n't fall again .
i went for the steak -- i love steak .   we ate quickly ,
we pulled over for a lunch break .
we had a choice of steak or chicken .
he expected a bunch of us to fall out .
he warned us that later , further down , would be be tougher .
the raft headed down the river .   the man in the back , our leader , ...
... and when that was done we got on the raft again
the boat was really slow .   i thought , no problem .
i was rowing and thought it was boring .
i tapped my friend tony .
i tapped him and said , " that 's white water rafting ? "
the boat suddenly shot down ; the rapids were churning all around us .
i flew out of the raft -- i was dumbfounded .
i was lost -- i could n't find the boat .   the boat came around ...
... i waved at the raft , and they came and got me ...
there were tents set up all over .
i arrived on friday night .
we , deafies , went to maine for white water rafting .
really , last weekend , i got together with twenty friends
we were ready for our great adventure !
... and another guy , mike daisy , who also fell off .
we had to be patient because we got up at seven o'clock in the morning .
we stayed up very late . the next morning we woke up .
we got back into our seats .   i was a bit shaken ..
there was a lot of beer everwhere , and people mingling .
they pulled me back onto the raft .
we got in the bus , took off , and arrived to one river .
we went in the bus after breakfast .
she threw up a little , it was really nothing big , it was as if she had a cold or something .
but she spit up the water .
she was coughing and i thought maybe we would have to do cpr on her .
i pulled her close with the paddle and then pulled her back on .
they will know when it is the right time to stop rowing or drag the paddle .
i held my paddle out to her .
there were eight of us in the raft ,   and both people in front had to be hearing .
so i can follow how to row .
we started to sit down .
we had a leader that sat at the back of the raft .
i have to admit that it was my first time .
i did n't know what to do -- i thought it would feel like being on a boat on the water .   i thought it was n't a big deal .
it was close by , twenty minutes away from our camp ground .
we sat on the raft .
so we sat down and got ready .
the leader would yell but we deaf people can not hear him in the back .
most of us got in the spa .
we just sat and relaxed -- aaahhh ...
... and called it a day .   we pulled over .
we got back on the bus and arrived at the campground .
really , everything was fine ; the girl was worried .
i arrived ...
it is ironic because we both fell before ,
the only left was me and mike daisy . it 's ironic that us two stayed on .   it is strange .
the raft went down some rapids -- really , it was fifteen feet straight down
i looked at him and said ok , that is fine .
we went down and many people fell off .
i braced myself as we went down -- i was expecting to fall out .
... i do n't know , it started with a k.   it 's a long word , that river .
i pulled people back onto the raft .
one woman who was riding with us ...
... was stuck under the boat and could not breathe for a while .
i reached under the raft and found her .
... but he and i were the ones to " survive " that drop .

the pigs blew on the fire and it grew .
a wolf saw the three pigs ; they all screamed and hid , each in his own house .
this is the story of the three pigs .
wolf arrived .
the pig went into the wood house .   he and his brother asked themselves what they should do .   they sat down together .
it was a beautiful brick house .
the pigs felt the roof vibrating .   they looked up ...
the wolf looked at the house .   it looked different -- it was made of brick .
he slowly and laboriously laid the bricks .   he slowly built the house .
the wolf held his sore behind in relief , then ran away .   the three pigs happily celebrated and danced .   they lived together for ever after .
the wolf inhaled deeply and blew at the house .   the grass house blew away .
the three pigs said , " no , we 'll see about that .   go ahead -- try . "
the wolf went to the grass house and looked it over .
to build his house , he chopped up trees .
the third pig was a hard worker , and liked to decorate .
wolf inhaled deeply and then blew the house away .
the pigs looked up .   the wolf looked down the chimney and started to climb down .   his tail hung down under him .   the fire burned beneath him .
there is a wood house .
the wolf was getting more angry .   " again ! " he yelled . " one , two , three ... " he took another deep breath and blew at the house .
the pig refused . he closed and locked the door , sat , and waited .
the two pigs were left under the open air ; they were sitting , looking around , and saw the wolf !
the grass house was blown away .   the pig looked around in shock .
he cut down some grass ...
again , there is the grass house .
wolf looked at them and said , " i am ready to catch and eat you ! "
... on which area each would have and went ahead to start setting them up .
he built himself a house made of wood .
the wolf said , " i 'm ready to eat you three .   i 'll do it . "
" i smell pigs .   where are the pigs that smell so delicious ? "   thought the wolf .
she informed the three pigs that it was time for them to go away and be on their own .
wolf said , " i warned you , one ... two ... three ... "
then what happened was a wolf arrived in the area
the house still stood strong .   the pigs started celebrating even more .
" i could go up to the roof and down the chimney , " the wolf thought , and he started climbing .   the three pigs stopped celebrating inside the house .
but ...   he did n't decorate a whole lot , either .   he was just average .
... bundled the grass , and built his house with that .
a mother took care of her three pigs .
the three pigs said " ok , " and then left .
the pig looked up to see the wolf staring at him .
the wolf wondered what he should do .   he looked around the house and saw the chimney coming out from the roof .
" i will visit often , " she said .
the next pig , well , he was n't lazy ...
wolf chased after the pigs .   two pigs went into the brick house .
he looked and got scared .   he got up and ran to the wood house .
the wolf started to get angry .   when the three pigs realized that they were safe , they began to celebrate .
the house was still standing ; it was a strong house .   the wolf was surprised .
the wolf looked at the pig and said , " ok , i warned you . one ... two ... three ... "
so the first pig had a grass house .
one of the pig 's tended to be lazy and just do things ' well enough ' .
she said " go ahead and build your homes " .
the pig , i mean , the wolf arrived and stared at him .
... and realized that the wolf was trying to come down the chimney .   " ahh ! hurry ! " they said and hastily built a fire in the fireplace .
he did n't want a fancy house .
wolf reached down to attack , but two pigs ran away towards the brick house just before wolf could catch them .
the three pigs went out looking for a location .
when the three pigs grew up ...
he arrived at the wood house .
the wolf looked toward the pigs and said , " fine .   ready ? ... " he took a deep breath and blew at the house .
" i warn you , get out or else i will snatch you and eat you up ! " wolf said .
the pigs went in and discussed what to do ; they closed and locked the windows and doors .
the fire began to burn the wolf 's tail .   the wolf threw himself out of the chimney ; he flew out .
the wolf was surprised .   he had been confident that he would destroy the house .   he looked back at the house .
he tended to put a lot of effort into his work .
the pigs said , " what should we do ?   let 's wait and see . "
each pig went off in their own direction .
he built a ( wood , no ) brick house .
they finally found an area . they all seemed to agree ...
the wolf landed in a pond ; a ball of steam rose from the pond .
then he will go and buy another book .
the teacher expects john to read a lot .
when that 's done , when he 's read the book , he will give it to the teacher .
john is in the house right now reading a book .
his parents have been giving and buying him books for a while now .
( the teacher ) regularly watches him ,   encouraging him to read .
what he is crazy about reading about is cars .
he pulls off the lid ...
the victim 's body still lies there limp .   he is frustrated .
the house shakes again , louder and worse than before .   he ran downstairs .
he pries open each corner .
" i ... it must ... i do n't know "
he replaces the cover .
... and he nails the lid back on .   he is exhausted .
from now on , i wo n't sleep . that 's it .
" i wo n't go to sleep . "
he walked upstairs .   " it could n't be ... "
" it must be a head trip or something , "
he rushes downstairs and pries the lid off
the coffin shakes violently
he takes off the lid and a hand reaches out of the coffin and chokes him !
he looks at the limp body in the coffin
he puts the cover back on and nails each corner .
" nah , i am fine , " he reassures himself .
when the sun rises , he asks himself , what was that , with the shaking ?
" what was that ? " he asked .   " i do n't know . "
" i think it was only a dream , or just my imagination about things .   i do n't know -- forget it , " he said
" i am fine , " he said .
he drank coffee all day .
he continues through the forest as lightning strikes and rain pours .
he spots his victim in the distance ; the victim looks back over his shoulder , as the husky man continues to walk in persuit .
through a forest road lurches a husky person .
the sun sets .   lightning strikes .   rain falls .
the trees pass by , as lightning strikes and rain pours .
he keeps drinking cofffee .
a person was holding heart while carrying dead person .
the tapper thrusts his hand into his victim 's body and pulls out the heart .   he picks up the body and slings it onto his shoulder .
" i 'll go to sleep , " he says .   he gets under the covers ...
taps the shoulder .   the tappee turns , then looks forward again .
he keeps drinking it through sundown .
the attacker walks through the forest , up a winding path to a house .
the attacker takes a big bite of the still - beating heart , then throws it away .
he nailed down each corner of the lid and pushed the coffin back .
" ok ... " and he puts the cover back on .
" that person is somewhere inside the house .   oh , no ... "
" ... and i ate his heart ! "
there is a lound banging , and the house shakes .
" i killed him , " the person said .
sunset and then sunrise .   the house starts shaking loudly .
he gets out of bed and goes downstairs to see what is happening .
he puts the cover back on and nails down each corner .
he yawned , went upstairs , and went to bed .
he takes down a pry bar and pries open the coffin at each corner .
he picks up the victim 's body and lays it in the coffin .
he turns the doorknob , kicks open the door , and picks his victim back up .
he puts his victim down .   there is a wood coffin .
he removes the lid .
he gets his crow bar and opens the coffin
he walks upstairs and goes to sleep .
the sun sets , and just at dawn again the banging and the shaking begin
" nah , i must have imagined things . "
" i 'm going back to bed , " the man said .
" i better get going , " he said .
" nah , i must have imagined things , " he says to himself
he pries open the coffin
lightning strikes and rain pours .   a storm is whipping up .
two days go by , and he stays up , drinking coffee .
i will keep drinking coffee .
he lies back in bed .   the house starts shaking and banging around .
he stays awake , but eventually crashes and sleeps .
the attacker lays down his victim 's body .
it is empty .
" where did it go ? where did it go ? " he asks himself .
" really .... uh .... "
" really , is that man in here ? " he asks himself
he removes the coffin lid and looks in .

thirdly , the hospital often will discuss about the communication options .
it seems that parents must choose one between oralism , cochlear implant , sign language or cued - speech . they ca n't pick all of the options .
it is very intimidating . there will be seven professionals informing the two parents that their child seem to be sick or have the " cancer " .
that 's how powerful the language is .
we will be talking about early intervention now . when parents gives a birth to a baby , the baby would go to a hearing screening .
one group would use the word hit ; other group uses smashed ; and another group uses collided . i think there are four or five different words / groups .
then they would ask the hit group about the car and whether if the glass was broken .
there is another research in australia with the similar idea .
there are two groups with same guidelines . one group has deaf professionals being involved , while another group did not .
the researches have proven that a child with a deaf mentor often perform better . there is a research that studies two groups from utah and tennessee .
the early intervention services for both groups had the same checklist .
why do n't we discuss it as the journey through experience ?
ask the next group how fast were the cars going before they collided .
it seems like the hospital needed to intervene because the parents were doing lousy job with their child .
the baby is just deaf . it 's not their fault , they 're doing perfectly fine .
of course the parents would be scared . " i am sorry " is never a good thing .
similarly , the study asks them how fast were the cars going before they crashed into each other .
the study notices how the hit group thinks that the glass was n't broken at all .
then they regathered the groups a week later and asked them some questions .
therefore , overall , there 's a missing link . if we change that , it will influence the deaf children to develop better .
they often use the word " diagnosis " it 's very negative and it 's used for more negative references , such as sickness or cancer . or maybe terminal illness .
it makes sense because the parents will learn from the deaf mentor after including him / her in the family . the parents will start to realize how important it is to involve in the deaf community .
parents can not simply rely on a deaf mentor . they must do more such as being involved in the deaf community .
a deaf role model who has been trained can show the parents that he / she is perfectly fine .
he / she can read and write . he / she can communicate . he / she can work . he / she has an education . there 's a long list of that and he / she is perfectly fine .
that makes it to seem like an opportunity to do more than one .
they really can do all of the options . one family can choose to use sign language , and if another family wants to use speech , that 's fine .
why do n't they use a word like " identified " as in " i 've identified this child deaf " ? now it does not seem bad at all .
now parents often would start considering discussing with the hospital for the early intervention . but the word makes it seems like they are intervening .
the screening shows that the baby is deaf .
or ask the collided group about the car and if the glass was broken ?
the parents of the group with deaf professionals would get through the grief progress quicker and usually be able to move on quickly .
both locations had the same number of meetings ; same occurences of home visits ; same kind of school ; and the same resources .
except for utah group , the child had a deaf mentor , while the group from tennessee did not .
it would turn into a positive thing .
often in the meeting ; all people in the room are hearing except for the baby .
the car was going around 20 mph when it smashed . the smashed group said they think the car 's glass was broken and it was going around 60 mph . but , actually , the glass was n't broken at all .
why do n't we use " early involvement " , which means involving the parents by sharing the resources and working together ; and not intervening them .
then they would refer the parents to the early intervention professionals .
the meeting will include a specialist , audiologist , doctor , nurse , counselor , and social worker . there are seven specialists for only two parents . wow .
car was going only twenty to thirty mph . it shows how the language influences individuals ' answers even though they all were watching the same video clip .
for example , they used different words for each group while asking them the questions .
be friends with their child 's friend 's parents . it 's important to be connected and they must collaborate with others .
the parents will realize and embraces the situation more calmly . without a deaf role model , we are missing the link of connection between the parents and the deaf person .
the doctors often would say " we should discuss the grief progress . here 's the social worker and counselor , they will help you to nagivate the grief progress . "
the parents might will perceive this as something they should to be upset about .
or they will ask another group smashed about the car and whether if the glass was broken .
so , for the hit group , they asked them how fast were the cars going before they hit ?
" intervention " implies the need of intervening such as an intervention for drug addicts , stopping something from happening , or when a kid is not behaving well .
the first thing the doctor and nurse would say to the parents would be " i am sorry . " it 's an automatic negative . " i am sorry that your child is deaf " .
ask another group , the crashed group about the car and whether if the glass is broken .
not just in the hospitals , but in general .
there is one interesting study . what the study did they grouped people together and have them watch a video clip of car accident .
i will talk about the early invention field and how hospitals deal with informing the parents when the child is deaf .
there are so many things that are wrong with the system .
when a deaf child does not have a deaf mentor , the family will continue to be disappointed and their grief will last longer .
so , the family must have a deaf role model supporting them .
the study noticed that the deaf child from utah resulted in better social , emotion and cognitive developments .
we should bring in the deaf mentor to meet the parents .
i will list some . for example , the power of language in hospitals .
while for the deaf babies , they are not any of them .
it 's important that the child signs . hospitals do n't use ' communication opportunities ' as their word choices .

... while i was growing up until i was six   and a half years old .
we were okay with it , so that`s when my family moved there .
i moved into the dorm again . during that time , my parents had been living where they were for more than seven years , but i had already left home before that .
i never lived in a house ...
so i didn`t need to worry about attending a hearing school or a deaf school .
my mother taught my two brothers and me , so it was easier for us to move around .
there 's something strange about myself .
because his job involved a big project located south , in new york .
that went on for around six years .
so we moved south to new york
so basically , i almost never went home to except for vacations or long weekends , that`s when i would commute . but , most of the time i stayed in rochester ...
so , we agreed with the decision and went ahead and moved south to new york ; it was around an hour north of nyc .
so , the family in fact move here , and i took the opportunity to move in and live with my family at the new house in rochester .
so , may seem like i stayed there longer than seven years .     but then it hit me ...
i was like , “ oh , wow , that`s fine . ” he wanted to transfer to rochester because he wanted to work at rit too .
... for more than seven years .
when i was nearly all done with rit . after about my third year . my father sensed that he had pretty much had it with ibm ; he wanted to retire and change his career .
since then , i have lived there for around almost three years .
... for two years , when i was a junior and then a senior in high school . after i graduated from high school , i went to r.i.t . , rochester institute of technology .
so , it was n't worth it for him to commute frequently for a long distance , it was better for the family to move away .
i lived there in a house with my parents and two brothers ...
i decided i wanted to transfer   to the rochester institute .
my parents were alright with it . i transferred to rsd , i stayed in the dorm .
my family decided to move to vermont because my father got a job transfer with ibm .
i guess i should`ve been moving away again , but my parents were okay with the same job .
i graduated recently , so that`s means i`ll be looking for a job , probably i`ll move away , so i wo n't have lived there for seven years .    now , i`m wondering from now on with the new job does that mean i might be moving around again for the next seven years or less ?    so i`m wondering , let`s see , oh well .
i wanted to be involved in sports and after - school activities , plus many other things . i wanted to be more socialized . so ,
still when i was twelve and a half years old , after six and a half years in all , my father found out that he would have to move away again
but , you might wonder how i managed , with moving frequently , well i was home schooled .
i grew up there between the age of six and a half and thirteen .
i was born in florida .
