A long time ago in Central America in Nicaragua in that country .
There was a village .
This village was among lush mountains .
Among the people living there
was the village chief
called Kuma
I have assigned him this sign .
Kuma was a strong and courageous person
He could face animals such as the tiger the puma and many more .
He could face these animals
because he was strong and brave .
How / what happened ?
One night Kuma was at home sleeping
He was asleep and
He felt a roar
He woke up .
went out
looked down on ( the place )
and found a girl
who was crying and
naked .
Kuma looked at her and
he felt sorry for the girl .
and decided to pick her up .
" I will take care of you and my seven children
I will take care of the seven and this girl .
You will be called Arua . "
meaning " star of the night "
in short .
He assigned Arua
( her ) sign " Star " .
Kuma took Arua home and looked after her .
Kuma took Arua home and looked after her .
Years passed
Arua and Kuma ’s boys grew up together .
Arua was obedient good - hearted and very pretty .
One of the children the eldest approached Kuma
and said to him : " I want to marry Arua "
Kuma : " Wait wait . "
Later another brother also said he ’d want to marry her :
" I want to marry Arua "
Kuma : " Wait wait . "
The seven brothers stood before Kuma
and so did Arua .
Kuma : " Wait wait . "
All were arguing
" Wait wait . "
Let ’s make a deal let her decide
Whether she wants to marry or not .
I should not decide she should " .
Arua : " Wait "
She thought about it a little
" I want to wait
When I think about it
I will let you know
in the mean time wait . "
" I feel happy
I think waiting is good " thought Kuma .
Years passed and
The eldest son went again to Kuma
" ( What ) does ( Arua ) want ?
She did not speak a word .
I would like to ask her again to marry me "
( but ) [ Arua ] ( stayed ) silent
Arua has not said anything . "
This son and the other sons ( asked themselves ): " How do we resolve this ?
( because ) Arua ( has not said ) anything about marriage
( she continues ) to be silent " .
All present there said : " Okay
The seven of us will have to fight each other
the one who wins in strength and skills will marry Arua " .
The father ( was ) behind them hiding and
he listened .
" ( My ) children want to ( ( ? ) ) " he said to himself concerned .
The seven kids left .
The father ( stayed ) thinking .
" I 'm going to go to consult the wizard . "
" I want to ask you the wizard ...
Let me explain
My seven children want to fight each other to death
The one who wins
will get married to Arua .
I need your advice .
Help me please . "
( The wizard looked at him ) " You ... " .
I 'm going to give you a solution
There is a solution and
I 'm going to give it to you
but it is very painful
Not as bad as the death of your children
a little less painful . "
" What ?
Please advise ! " ( said Kuma . )
" Kill Arua it should be better for you . "
( Kuma ) reflected on the words .
" It ’s quite clear ! You had adopted her
You brought her up
and now what ?
Are you happy for adopting her ? "
( Kuma ) reflected on the words .
Night approached
( Kuma ) walked away
into the distance
thinking all along .
" How [ can this be possible ] ?
When I saw ( the child ) I had felt sorry for her
I felt sorry for that child and
I took her into my arms .
If another [ child ] appeared in the future I would ( likewise ) take it in ..
Kuma ( continued to ) think about the solution .
He went home .
The next day at sunrise
( Kuma ) went to the wizard ’s house again .
and called out ( to the wizard ) .
" I have found another solution
I give you other solution . "
" Do you have [ another solution ] ?
What is it ?
Explain the other solution to me . "
" It would be better leave Arua in the middle of the forest "
" But how are you going to leave her ( in the forest ) ?
You know that there are animals there : tigers pumas ...
They will eat her
They will catch
her and kill her .
You are cold blooded . [ ? ]
G
Moreover ( your ) seven sons will miss ( her ) company
and they will surely go looking for her .
( Kuma was ) thoughtful .
[ And finally ] went ( and )
left her on mount .
to her fate .
The next morning she was alone in the forest .
Arua was alone ( and scared ) .
In the evening ( Arua feared the approaching ) night .
and walked ( terrified )
She felt a pain in her heart .
( Arua ) walked
The forest became darker
and shadows covered her .
As she walked
She looked around
stopped
She looked around
She had felt the presence [ of something ]
A tiger was approaching
( but ) she saw ( nothing )
She looked in all directions ;
She felt comforted
There was nothing .
What a melancholy ! How painful ! " .
( Arua ) walked
and she stopped again
She could n't ( walk any more ) .
and sat scared
It was completely dark .
and there was a ray of light in the forest and
the moon lit up over her .
( Arua ) looked at the moon .
" I will help you .
Let me explain
I will give you shelter and take care of you .
I will defend you from the animals from the tiger .
Calm down I will help you . "
( Arua gazed up at the moon amazed ) " You are talking to me . "
A flower blossomed in front of the dumbfounded Arua
illuminated by the light of the moon .
I do not recognise this ( she thought )
while she looked at the flower .
The petals opened more and more
and wrapped around her completely .
Arua fell asleep inside the flower
She did not feel any pain and
relaxed
as the flower closed completely around her .
The next day at sunrise
The seven sons of Kuma [ began ] looking for her and
searched everywhere
" Where could Arua be ? " ( they asked ) .
( And started ) to search .
There were a few foot prints in the ground
They followed the footprints
They walked in a row following the footsteps
( to the point where ) the footprints disappeared .
" She is not here " they said astounded upon reach that point .
The seven looked for Arua around the place
" Where ( could she be ) ? "
The seven gazed into the distance
at the flower containing Arua .
When the seven looked at the flower
The flower containing Arua closed
The petals closed .
with Arua inside .
Upon seeing this
The seven headed ( towards the flower ) .
as they approached   it
The seven were transformed into butterflies and
( began to ) flit around the flower
( but ) not close ( to it )
( That ) would kill them
It was a dangerous flower .
The butterflies rose in the air flying
and disappeared into the distance .
A dog sitting opposite
Hmm ...
They look at the jar surprised
Leaves It
and begins to search here

" The three pigs and the wolf " .
I ’m going to tell ( this story ) .
( There are ) three pigs
The two ... three of them are siblings .
Each one has a different character .
The first loves to play
The second also ( likes ) playing
and the third is serious
focused on work .
Let me explain .
Another ( personality is ) the wolf which wants to eat ( them )
eat them
It wants to eat the three pigs all three of them .
I am going to explain .
A person ... No sorry .
A pig is building what ? a house how do he does that ? with bundles of straw .
It is working ( fast )
to finish the house quickly .
( The pig ) has just finished
and leaves / goes .
The pig calls :
" Look brother I won
The house of straw bundles is already finished . "
The brother is surprised : Oh !
Another pig the second one is also working ( on a house ) a wooden house .
And works quite a bit .
The house is finished .
" Look the two ( houses have been built ) the same " ( said the pig with the wooden house ) .
Let ’s see how   the third and final pig ( is building its ) house .
( It is making it ) with bricks
It is taking a long time ( to build the house ) .
" Brother
You are working ( very hard ) " said the pig .
The pig ( responds ): " I know I know .
Stop it will be safe " .
He ( continues ) working
The two ( siblings ) continue talking
and playing .
And as they move away
by chance the wolf hears them .
( The wolf ) comes nearer ( quietly )
It sees them
It prepares itself :
to take a step
( but ) makes noise
and the two ( pigs ) the same ones as before which were playing hear ( the noise ) .
" Warning ! :
the wolf is here
The wolf comes ! " ( the pigs scream ) .
They escape each running away on its own
They escape each running away on its own
( One ) to the house of b ... bundles of straw and enters
another enters the wooden house
and the third in the one built with bricks enters ( also at home ) .
The wolf approaches quietly
" Hello " ( says joker ) .
One of the ( terrified ) pigs look out the window .
" Hey the wolf is coming " ( it thought ) .
and warns :
I will huff ' n puff with ease
and bring ( your ) house down " .
" No ( I do n’t think so " says ) the pig .
" Yes yes " ( answers the wolf convincingly . )
( The wolf ) gets ready
The wolf moves back .
" the house is there " ( it calculates ) .
( The wolf ) takes a deep breath
( and after ) filling its chest ( with air )
blows ( strongly ) .
The house is shaken .
The pig watches in desperation
The bales of hay are thrown about
and the house is torn down .
stunned the pig flees
and runs to
the wooden house
where its brother had entered .
( Pig ) enters .
" Brother
My house has been blown down
down
by the wolf .
" Blown down ? Really ? " ( it asked the brother puzzled ) .
" Yes now it is coming ( to your house ) " .
The ( brother ): Relax
One can hardly ( pull down ) a wooden house
It is solid " .
The ( wolf ) moves back .
The wolf continues .
It walks ( tracking the area ) .
" There
There is a wooden house
There is the second house " thought the wolf .
It goes near ( the house )
( and jokingly says ): Hello !
The two ( terrified ) pigs look out the window .
They look at each other
.
" Wait " ( said ) the wolf to them .
( The wolf ) moves back .
It is prepared
breathes ( deeply )
( until ) its lungs are full ( of air )
and blows ( the air ) out
blows .
The house is shaken .
" Almost .. Its tough tough
I have blown
and it has ( only ) been shaken " ( thought the wolf ) .
I will do it a second time .
( The wolf ) takes a ( deep ) breath
( and after ) filling its lungs ( with air )
blows ( strongly ) .
The house is shaken .
until it breaks apart .
The wooden poles fly off .
The two pigs ( witness ) that the house is breaking apart
( until there stands ) an empty space .
( The two pigs desperately ) run
and flee .
The wolf ( stays ) calm :
" Now for the last and third house ( to fall ) for sure .
The one made with bricks " .
The two ( pigs ) enter ( the third house ) .
" Brother brother ! "
( The brother who was ) building : " What ? "
" Brother
Look .
The two houses of your two brothers his and mine have disappeared " ( they say nervously ) .
because the wolf has blown " ( them said the pig nervously ) .
The third ( brother ): " I know
Calm down this   house is impossible ( to break )
The construction is solid " ( said the third pig ) .
" Are you sure ? " ( asked ) the brother .
" Do you know why ?
I have worked for very long on this house
to ( make the house ) safe .
Now it is finished
Well almost finished " ( says the third pig ) .
You ( built ) yours too fast - the two brothers-
That is why ( your homes are ) weak .
The two brothers ( stay ) silent : " Aha
Are you sure ?
( The wolf ) is coming ! "
( The wolf ) is coming ! "
The wolf comes nearer ( quietly )
" There is the house
How beautiful !
It is a strong house " ( thought the wolf ) .
It approaches ( the house )
" Hello ” ( says the wolf mockingly ) .
The three pigs approach the window .
The two brothers are trembling with fear
They both look at ( the third brother ) .
The last brother the third one says : " Relax " .
Look through the window
" I ’m going to prepare myself wait " .
The wolf moves back .
It is ready
( The wolf ) fills its lungs ( with air )
and blows .
The house does not move
It is solid .
and does not move .
There is no movement inside the house
It stays upright .
" I do n't understand
I('ll try ) again " ( thinks the wolf ) .
( The wolf ) moves back .
breathes twice
until the lungs are full of air
and blows .
The mass of air impinges on the house .
( The wolf ) continues blowing
( but ) the house ( just ) vibrates
Nothing ( happens )
" I 'll try for the third time " ( thinks ) the wolf .
It breathes in once more
and blows .
It turns red from the effort
and after blowing out all the air
its jaw gets dislocated .
The house had not moved .
" How ( can that be ? thinks the unbelieving wolf ) .
This is impossible
The house is solid .
( The wolf takes ) a look ( at the house )
and sees ( something at the top ) .
( The wolf has ) an idea
On the roof is a chimney
that is billowing smoke .
" I will take advantage of the chimney " ( thinks the wolf ) .
The wolf climbs on the roof .
The three brothers ... the two : " Look Up Up Up Up ! "
The ( third brother ): " Relax
Come . "
The pig puts a pot on the fireplace
fills the pot with water
Lights a fire .
The wolf ignores ( this )
and climbs on the roof
and goes down the chimney
( thinking ): " I will now go down easily through here " .
The wolf is at the mouth of the chimney
It begins to descend
and to get to the bottom ... " Burning hot ! " ( shouts the wolf ) .
and quickly goes up the fireplace
and escapes steaming .
The third ( brother ): " Are you guys OK ? "
The two men : " were right
the house is safe . "
End .
[ In the story there is ] a child whose sign is this [ hair - child ]
A dog whose sign is this [ dog - ear ]
And a frog whose sign is this [ sack - vowel - of - frog ] .
The child ( was in ) his room
( and it ) was night
( They were ) in bed both of them
with a glass jar ( in which was ) a frog [ its sign ]
The two ( were ) looking ( at the jar )
and the frog looked at ( them )
They got into bed and fell asleep .
The frog pulled itself out the mouth of the jar
stretched its legs to get out
and left .
The child and the dog slept until sunrise
They woke up with the frog in mind
( but ) when they got up
The glass jar was empty :
" How can that be ? "
The dog [ dog - ear ] looked searched and rummaged everywhere
Looked under the bed and
even looked inside a boot .
Where could it be ?
They also called out to it ( where could it be ? )
The boy opened the window
And he called out frog .
The dog who had his snout in the jar jumped out of the window .
The boy ( who was ) looking for ( the frog ) and calling ( the frog ) felt a ( big ) rumble .
" It was the dog when it jumped out the window " ( he said ) and ( also ) jumped out .
Lifted the animal in his arms
and it licked his face
because the glass jar had shattered on the floor .
He took it in his arms
and it licked his face
and they began to walk
calling out to the frog .
( They arrived ) to a forest with many trees and there was a wasp hive in one of them .
The child called out ( to the frog )
and the dog meanwhile was walking through the forest .
" Frog ! You Frog ! "
searching among the grass it discovered something
A hidden burrow . It approached the burrow and called : Frog ! "
and from inside came out a smelly rodent .
while the dog jumped trying to reach the hive .
The boy continued searching .
There was a dark hole in a tree
The boy
climbed up
and looked inside .
An owl a nocturnal bird with large eyes flew out the hole and scared him
The boy fell backwards .
at that moment the dog was chased by a swarm of wasps
and the dog ran away .
" Complicated " ( thought ) the child which had fallen
They continued on their way
searching
The child climbed up on a stone
behind which were some branches .
He touched them and they began to move .
He was standing on something that was also moving ( without knowing what it was )
and when he was relaxed an animal emerged .
What a fright ! it was a deer
and he had stood on its back !
I could not understand how ( this was possible )
The dog barked
while the child galloped on the back of the deer
at full speed
until the ruminant stopped
and the boy flew out .
The dog which was barking was likewise thrown
The two rushed
and fell into the water .
When in the water ( he said ) " What a fright ! "
The dog barks
" Shh ! I 've heard the frog it is there . "
He placed his hands ( on the ground )
There was a fallen tree
He placed his hands
and he peered over the top .
The dog also peered
supporting its feet on the trunk .
The child searched for the frog from there .
" Oh ! " Amazing ! The two our frog and another they are a couple are wedded .
Surprising .
How beautiful ! "
Incredible ( they have had ) many offspring
( All ) jumping .
" Beautiful . "
The boy picked his frog in his hand
and was walking away ( but )
he returned again
returned the frog
and said goodbye .
In a field between green mountains
lay   a tree .
The weather was hot like in the summer .
continues
A man climbed up the tree ( with a ladder )
this was a pear tree .
He began picking pears to pack into the sack he was carrying .
He had a beard and was wearing a wide - brimmed hat
( and ) was plucking pears from different branches
The man was at the tree top
picking the pears .
when a pear fell rolling outside the sack .
The man continued picking pears and upon finishing
he climbed down the tree
( Under the tree ) there was a line of three baskets
containing pears ( that the man had emptied ) from the sack
He put the pears in the baskets .
He picked a pear and observed it carefully .
It was the pear that had fallen earlier .
He took it in his hands and looked to see if it was clean
" Ah ! " " I ( can ) clean it with the handkerchief ” ( he thought )
and put it in the basket with care .
He saw that the baskets were getting full
climbed back into the tree
( and ) continued collecting pears .
Then came another person a boy wearing a hat on a huge bike .
The man continued plucking pears .
The child on the bike approached   pedalling at a good pace .
He looked up the tree
( and ) saw a man .
He looked down
" I want one of these pears from the basket " ( he thought ) .
He looked back at the man .
" just one " ( he thought )
" to hell I prefer a basket . "
He looked ( at the man at the tree top and decided ) .
Then he took the basket picked it up and placed it ( on the handlebar )
After loading the basket on the bike
he climbed on the bike
but could hardly manage to ride the bike
because ( the handlebar ) was heavy .
He continued pedalling with difficulty and continued on his way .
In the meantime the man in the tree was oblivious to everything
and picking fruit
not concerned about anything
all by himself
The man kept ( at his task which is what ) saved the child ( who ) disappeared into the distance
cycling the heavy bike with difficulty
zig zagging along .
It is hard cycling a bike around bends .
A girl happened to also pass by on a bike
of a similar age to the boy .
The ( girl ’s ) bike was approaching .
and the boy was still trying to manage his bike
The girl was cycling gracefully .
( She was ) a little pretentious
and very pretty
( and was ) riding ( her bike )
Both bikes crossed .
the boy continued pedalling spellbound
He looked at her spellbound .
His hat fell ( to the ground )
but he continued pedalling without taking his eyes off her
along the road
when the bike collided with a stone
( and ) he fell
The pears he was carrying in the basket on the handlebar rolled and scattered on the floor .
and the girl continued ( as if nothing had happened )
( The boy got injured ) when he fell
" I have hurt my knee badly!"-he said in pain and began to rub it .
He then saw three young boys
approaching
They had seen the whole scene
( and had seen ) him falling from the bike .
They had seen him
" Look at him ! " ( they thought )
One of the youngsters carried a ball on a racket .
It was a spade type racket with a ball tied to it that bounced back and forth .
He was playing with it without much enthusiasm .
What did the three do ?
( They ) help(ed him ) .
Since the child had fallen
they helped him .
Two of them approached the boy
wondering what they could do .
They began to put back all the pears in the basket .
everything was back in place in the basket .
The boy climbed on the bike
and thanked the youngsters
He put the basket ( on the handlebar ) .
and cycled away
The three youngsters walked away
While the boy cycled into the distance .
The three children were walking two continued ( and )
one noticed
the forgotten hat
that had fallen to the ground
and he whistled to the boy .
The boy on the bicycle heard the whistle
and turned to see where it came from
" Wait ! "
He took the hat to the boy
and handed it over .
The boy gave him three pears in appreciation for having recovered his hat .
Upon receiving the fruit the boy thanked him
" Thank You he said "
and left .
The boy on the bicycle also left
One of the three boys who were walking
distributed the pears between them .
They continued walking .
In the meantime the man who was up in the tree climbed down .
loaded with pears
He was surprised
to see that one of the three baskets
had disappeared . " It ca n't be " he said .
He looked back ( at the baskets )
" This is weird ! Very confusing ! " He said unbelievingly
learning on the tree trunk .
When the three boys approached
he looked at them attentively
( and saw that ) they had pears .
They continued on their way
" How strange ! " he thought " this ca n’t be true . "
( The youngsters ) went away

Hello !
I am going to narrate ( a story ) about pears
I am going to narrate it .
The scene of this story is a grove with pears
A man with a hat
( was ) picking [ pears ]
up in the tree .
He climbs up the ladder
Climbs down
Climbs up ...
( There are ) three baskets .
He continues working
Until he
fills three ( baskets ) with the pears he picked from the tree .
And just then ...
a man passes by
( The first man ) sees the second one
( He was walking ) with a goat
He walked past with the goat on a leash
Strolling along
And then ... [ The first man ] is still up
The man ( is ) up in the tree
harvesting
[ the pears ] .
The man walking the goat
passed by with the leash in hand
into the distance
( and ) disappeared
into the distance .
Another ( person ) a boy
on a bike
approaches
( The child ) looks ( on the floor )
( and ) sees
three baskets there .
He looks up
[ The man ] continues ( picking pears )
working away
picking pears
and placing them in his apron
( The child ) looks at him
and looks at ( the baskets )
( and wonders whether to )
take [ ? ]
take a basket
He uprights the bike
puts the basket on top of the bicycle
( and ) leaves .
pedalling
into the distance .
The man ( is ) working up ( in the tree )
picking ( pears )
and then climbs down the tree
he kneels on the ground
You know what ?
he kneels
( and ) empties the pears from his apron .
( Strange he thought ) I had left it here ...
( there ) were three
( There are only ) two now ...
He rises
leans against the tree
to think : " Weird "
Just then three children come by
eating pears
( The man ) looked at them
The child on a bike yes him
( Continues riding ) the bike
( when ) another girl also on a bike approached
The boy cycled hooking his gaze ( at the girl )
they approached
[ something ] went wrong
and they crashed
and fell to the ground .
The pears fell
( and ) scattered on the floor .
The girl cycled into the distance .
Three children came by
( and ) saw ( the boy on the ground )
This is why he fell
it was clear .
They approached the boy
( and ) helped him .
The boy had fallen
( and ) the basket too
They began putting the pears back into the ( basket ) [ that had fallen to the ground ]
( and when it was ) full
They put the basket in place
on the bicycle
( and the boy ) thanked them
The bike was ready to move
and ( the boy ) left .
[ One of the three children ] saw a hat .
The boy had forgotten the hat
and he was getting away .
" Wait ! "
" the hat "
" Ah ! "
" They gave the hat "
The child thanked them
" Here three pears for helping me . "
He takes three ( pears from the basket )
( and ) gave them to the children .
The [ other ] boy receiving the pears said " Thank You "
( and ) they leave .
( The boy ) distributed the pears .
Those three children who are coming
( are ) the same ones as before
( the ones I mentioned ) before
The three children passed by .
The man followed them with his eyes
He though they had stolen the pears .
No ( it was the ) other ( boy ): the boy on the bicycle .
The man was confused .
We have come to the end
Right ?
