Once upon a time ( there was ) a boy in bed .
What ( was he doing ) ? Looking at a jar .
Next to him ( was ) his dog .
This boy was in bed
covered with a blanket
and fell asleep .
in front of him ( was ) a jar with a frog ( inside ) .
Then in the morning the boy sat at the foot of the bed looked at the jar ...
" incredible the frog had disappeared " ( thought the boy ) .
The boy and the dog searched all over
The frog had disappeared from the jar .
They looked for it everywhere
They looked through the window
The dog sniffed at the jar
The boy did not trust ( the dog ):
" It ( must have been ) you you dog you .
You took the jar . "
At last ! The boy and the dog began to walk
Wait wait .
They walked through the forest
Looking for ( the frog ) .
( The boy called out ) " Frog ! "
and loudly
" Come come ! "
What can we do !
the boy continued searching ( he looked ) inside a burrow .
But with no luck .
The dog saw a hive in a tree .
upright on its hind legs he played ( with it ) .
The boy continued the search ( through the forest ) .
went around a wide tree trunk at its bottom
Looked inside the space between the branches
but nothing
Later in that tree ( do you know what happened wit)h the dog and the bee hive ? a swarm began to emerge from the hive .
The bees were flying ( towards the dog )
and the dog ran ( desperately )
The swarm went away ( chasing the dog ) .
A bird appeared above the boy .
( The boy ) was searching in a stone
and the bird was flying ( above him ) .
( The boy ) looked up
It was an owl .
( The boy ) looks at it ( surprised )
The boy climbed on to an oblong stone
and continued as before calling ( to the frog ):
" Frog where are you ? "
and loudly
What ( happened ) after that ? ( There appeared ) a deer and the boy climbed onto the deer ’s back .
( Do you know ) how ? The boy [ lay ] with his back on the deer
and the deer began running with the boy on top of it .
the deer slipped
the boy was thrown to the ground
and fell into a puddle of water .
( The boy ) pulled his head out of the water
with the dog on his neck
smiling and staring into the distance .
" Dog look ... "
The boy said ( to the dog ):
" Dog silence wait ... "
Behind the tree trunk
Wait shh ! "
The boy climbed up the trunk
he peered to look ( behind the trunk ) .
" Shh !
Let me see
Dog wait
I 'm going to look . "
( The boy ) got nearer .
The dog also approached
and they both looked . " Geez . "
( From the bottom someone asked ) what is up there ?
( from the top someone asked ) what is down there ?
( There were ) two frogs together with their heads stuck together .
The boy and the dog rejoiced
And they sat on the trunk
to contemplate and admire ( that scene ) .
The boy ( said to the dog ):
" Dog come on
( They have ) progeny ( It is ) their family
Let them alone . "
The boy and the dog said goodbye

After that
the dog ( and ) the boy go to bed .
They sleep .

( the frog ) had disappeared

After that they both ( the boy and the dog ) " Finally ! "
( The frogs ) gave them a frog
( and the boy ) took it in his hand .
That ’s it .
I summarized ( it ) ...
A person similar to a cowboy
climbed up [ a tree ]
to pick pears
He is collecting pears .
and one falls [ to the ground ]
The person climbs down [ the tree ]
and after emptying his catch of pears
picks a pear
wipes it
and leaves it [ in the basket ] .
A man appears cycling to his right
and approaches
and stops ( opposite him ) .
He then prepares [ the basket ]
places it on the bike
climbs on the bike
leaves the basket
and returns
to raise the basket .
He then places the basket on the wheel
you know where ah on the ...
on the front wheel
The man then rides standing up on the bike
not seated on the bike
He rides standing up
pedalling hard
Someone arrives on a bike
and they both crash into each other
The person falls down
and pears spread on the floor
Three other persons ( appear and ) approach the place walking
" You have to be careful ” ( they say )
And help put the pears in the basket .
Then one leaves to the right and another leaves to the left
The person ( on the right ) is playing with a racquet
I think ( he has ) a ball
I ’m not sure
He was playing with the racquet
The ( other ) child calls out to him
and the child ( with the racket ) turned around and came closer
He then gives him two
( although ) he should have only given him one
he gives him two [ pears ]
( The other person ) accepts
and ( I think ) he thanked him
I am deaf ( I do n’t know if I told him )
The child returns
and gives them a pear each
( but ) is there one for him too ?
I 've gone blank
It ’s OK
Well the three of them started walking
The man returns
-the earlier one-
to climb the tree
He is collecting pears
and climbs down the tree
The three children appear again
and come closer to the man
who prepares ... Oops
I made a mistake
Well I 've interrupted the narration
Wait
Three children arrive
Then exactly ( it was that ) the man argues with them
The three then depart
into the distance .
I think so right ?
That is all
I was born a long time ago in a village
( When I was ) a child communication was ...
( I did n't ) understand ( my ) parents at all
Neither did I understand ( my ) grandfather / grandmother .
( The one ) I understood best was a child friend of ( mine )
Both of us could communicate with each other
In our own way / using our code we could [ communicate ] .
And as time passed
( Everything ) went on well I enjoyed [ that time ] ( really ) well
( But ) not with ( my ) parents ...
Later on
I was taken to Lugo to the school
( And ) I was registered there .
I understood ( what was ) being said .
I understood things
I received lessons on culture
I understood things
After class I communicated easily with the children outside [ on the playground ] .
I used to enjoy communicating a lot .
I used to enjoy communicating a lot .
After that I returned to the village
During the holidays
( But I was ) a little sad
A little bit ...
There was no communication ( with my ) parents
It was different
I had the same girl friend
when I returned
( The one ) I used to communicate with the same one
After that I returned [ to school in Lugo ]
I had the same teacher
It was a pleasure
Wonderful ...
just wonderful .
He explained ( things ) to me
( And ) I understood him ( very ) well .
( And ) time passed on like that
Until I finished school .
I returned back to the village
( And ) I ...
I did not feel comfortable
I then thought about
asking my parents
( And ) they told me I was free to choose
( So ) I went to Vigo .
I looked for a job
And I found one
In a monastery of nuns .
And as time passed
I got married
And then had children
( and ) now I am happy great
Life is good .
That is all .
( It was ) short .
Something brief ...
